The judges had ruled that it was <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discriminatory</span> for British law to deny a heterosexual couple such as them the right to a civil partnership, when same-sex couples have that right. But while Ms Steinfeld\u00a0and Mr Keidan celebrate, many heterosexual couples in Britain will be wondering what they have been missing out on.\n \n Civil partnerships first appeared in Europe in the late 1980s and 1990s, as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compromise</span> between supporters and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">opponent</span>s of gay marriage. They offered gay couples a legal partnership with most of the rights of marriage, without actually granting them the right to marry. Many gay-rights activists saw this as an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unsatisfactory</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fudge</span>, creating a system that was <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inherently</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inferior</span> to marriage, and continued to push for the real thing. In the 2000s, with public opinion in many Western countries continuing to soften, their efforts bore fruit: today, 27 countries allow same-sex marriage.\u00a0\n \n As they legalised gay marriage, countries that had previously had civil-partnership laws dealt with them in different ways. Some, like Ireland and Sweden, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abolish</span>ed civil partnerships <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">altogether</span>; they saw no need to keep a much-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">malign</span>ed <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compromise</span> once everyone could get married. But in seven European countries, and some states of America and Australia, civil partnerships are still permitted, even though gay marriage is legal. This includes countries such as Britain and Finland, in which they are only available to same-sex couples, and those like France and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Netherlands</span>, where they are available to heterosexual couples too. The rights <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">enshrine</span>d in these partnerships vary from place to place. The British versions are marriage in all but name, as are Dutch \u201cregistered partnerships\u201d. In France, though, a civil <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">solidarity</span> pact (PACS) <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">confer</span>s only some of the tax benefits and adoption rights of marriage, and can also be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">annulled</span> far more easily. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Remarkably</span>, civil partnerships in some countries have become increasingly popular among heterosexual couples. From 2012 to 2016, the number of heterosexual couples in France choosing to enter into a PACS increased by 20% to 184,000, while the number of marriages fell by 8% to 225,000.\n \n This <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">enthusiasm</span> for civil partnerships might <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">perplex</span> gay-marriage <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">advocate</span>s who for a long time regarded them as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inadequate</span>. But there are many reasons why a couple might prefer a civil partnership. In places like France, they allow couples to opt for a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">looser</span> form of commitment either <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">permanently</span> or for a trial period before choosing to marry. Others might prefer civil partnerships for personal or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ideological</span> reasons, even when they <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">confer</span> the same rights as marriage. Equal Civil Partnerships, a British <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">advocacy</span> group, suggests that some people \u201cwant to avoid the social expectations, pressures and traditions surrounding marriage\u201d in favour of \u201ca more modern form of legal union\u201d. Ms Steinfeld\u00a0and Mr Keidan took the government to court over civil partnerships because they viewed marriage as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sexist</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">patriarchal</span>. They told the BBC that they <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">associate</span>d it with a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">legacy</span> of treating women as property. Last week\u2019s ruling does not change Britain\u2019s civil partnership law, but calls upon the government to do so. As the government says it will study the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">judgment</span>, campaigners hope that British heterosexual couples will soon be able to commit to each other without saying \u201cI do.\u201d", "last": "2018_7_3_1.json", "next": "2018_7_4_2.json", "assistent": {"Netherlands": {"ex": ["n.
