Blame more expensive oil\n \n ![The rich world needs higher real wage growth](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180630_FND001_0.jpg) \n \n CENTRAL bankers and economists have spilled much ink in recent years on the question of why wages have not grown more. The average unemployment rate in advanced economies is 5.3%, lower than before the financial crisis. Yet even in America, the hottest rich-world economy, pay is growing by less than 3% annually. This month the European Central Bank devoted much of its annual <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shindig</span> in Sintra, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Portugal</span> to discussing the wage <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">puzzle</span>.\n \n Recent data show, however, that the problem rich countries face is not that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nominal</span> wage growth has failed to respond to economic conditions. It is that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> is eating up pay increases and that real\u2014that is, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span>-adjusted\u2014wages are therefore <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stagnant</span>. Real wages in America and the euro zone, for example, are growing more slowly even as the world economy, and headline pay, have both picked up (see chart).\n \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proximate</span> cause is the oil price. As the price of Brent crude oil, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">benchmark</span>, fell from over $110 a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">barrel</span> in mid-2014 to under $30 a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">barrel</span> by January 2016, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tumble</span>d, even turning <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">negative</span> in Europe. That <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spark</span>ed justified worries about a global <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deflationary</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slump</span>. But it was an immediate <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">boon</span> for workers, who saw <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nominal</span> pay increases of around 2% translate into real wage gains of about the same size. (An exception was Japan, where a rise in the sales tax from 5% to 8% in 2014 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeeze</span>d wallets.)\n \n Since then, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nominal</span> wage growth has gradually picked up as labour markets have tightened, roughly in line with the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prediction</span>s of economists who use broader measures of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slack</span> than just the unemployment rate. But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> has risen in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tandem</span> with wages, as the oil price has recovered to close to $75 a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">barrel</span>. That means many workers are yet to feel the benefit of the global economic upswing that began during 2017. In America and Europe, real wages are growing barely faster than they were five years ago, when unemployment was much higher. \n \n In the long run, changes in real wages are linked to changes in workers\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span>, which has grown slowly everywhere since the financial crisis. In the year to the first quarter of 2018, for example, American <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span> grew by only 0.4%. But some spy a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rebound</span>. For current forecasts of blazing economic growth in America to bear out, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span> must grow faster. In the second half of 2017, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span> in Britain grew at the fastest rate since 2005. The Bank of Japan thinks that firms there are investing heavily to boost <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span> so that they do not have to pay for higher wages by raising prices. \n \n Yet even a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">recovery</span> in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span> would not guarantee good times for workers. In recent decades the share of GDP going to labour, rather than to capital, has fallen because real pay has increased more slowly than <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span>. In advanced economies labour\u2019s share fell from almost 55% to about 51% between 1970 and 2015, according to researchers at the IMF. A widely heard explanation is that a fall in union membership, combined with rising offshoring and outsourcing, has <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">erode</span>d workers\u2019 bargaining power. More recently, economists have suggested that labour\u2019s falling share could be linked to the rise of \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">superstar</span>\u201d firms such as Google that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dominate</span> their markets and have low labour costs relative to their enormous profits. \n \n Reversing the fall in labour\u2019s share of GDP would require real wages to grow faster than <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span>, weighing on firms\u2019 profit margins. Continued tightening in labour markets might yet boost workers\u2019 bargaining power enough for that to happen, as was the case during the late 1990s and late 2000s, two unusual periods in which labour\u2019s share of GDP rose across the rich world. There is still room for improvement. For instance, even where unemployment rates are low, the number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs remains unusually high. This continues to weigh on wage growth, according to an analysis by the IMF late last year.\n \n Some countries, such as Italy, still suffer from unemployment rates that are far higher than they were before the financial crisis. Such pockets of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slack</span> might <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constrain</span> wages everywhere now that goods are produced in international supply chains and sold on global markets. In a recent working paper, Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that the influence on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> of global <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slack</span> and commodity prices has grown in the past decade, while local economic conditions have become less important. Philip Lowe, the governor of Australia\u2019s central bank, told the audience in Sintra that when he asks firms that are struggling to find workers why they do not pay more, they \u201clook at me as if I\u2019m completely <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mad</span>\u201d and deliver a lecture on how competitive the world has become.\n \n If <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slack</span> were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">eliminate</span>d everywhere, pay might rise faster. The question is whether <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> continues to rise in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tandem</span> as companies find that, when push comes to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shove</span>, they can pass higher costs onto their customers. If they can, there is little hope for much improving workers\u2019 lot in real terms. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in response to a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">perceive</span>d <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span>ary threat. The European Central Bank, too, is tightening, saying that it will probably stop asset purchases at the end of the year. Mario Draghi, its president, points to growth in hourly pay of 1.8% as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">justification</span> for the move.\n \n That seems a little <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hasty</span>, given workers\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lamentable</span> fortunes in recent decades. But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hawk</span>s think there is little room to boost real wages by running labour markets <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hotter</span>. If they are proved right, it will be hard to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refute</span> the argument that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">structural</span> changes in the economy, rather than weak demand alone, have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stack</span>ed the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deck</span> against workers. Governments will then have to find novel ways to respond\u2014or hope for another crash in the oil price.\n", "last": "2018_7_7_4.json", "next": "2018_7_7_6.json", "assistent": {"Portugal": {"ex": ["n. \u8461\u8404\u7259\uff1b\u3010\u56fd\u3011\u8461\u8404\u7259\uff1b\u8461\u8404\u7259\u5171\u548c\u56fd", "\u7f51\u7edc \u8461\u8404\u7259\u56fd\u5e86\u65e5\uff1b\u8461\u8404\u7259\u961f\uff1b\u91cc\u65af\u672c"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0"}, "eg2": []}, "barrel": {"pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['b\u00e6r\u0259l] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['ber\u0259l] "}, "ex": ["n. \u6876\uff1b\u67aa\u7ba1\uff1b\u4e00\u6876\uff08\u7684\u91cf\uff09", "v. \u98de\u9a70", "\u7f51\u7edc \u7435\u7436\u6876\uff1b\u5706\u7b52\uff1b\u6eda\u7b52"], "eg2": [["a beer/wine barrel", "\u5564\u9152\u6876\uff1b\u8461\u8404\u9152\u6876"], ["They got through two barrels of beer.", "\u4ed6\u4eec\u559d\u4e86\u4e24\u6876\u5564\u9152\u3002"], ["Oil prices fell to $9 a barrel.", "\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u964d\u5230\u4e86\u6bcf\u6876 9 \u5143\u3002"], ["Life hasn't exactly been a barrel of laughs lately.", "\u6700\u8fd1\u751f\u6d3b\u5e76\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u4ee4\u4eba\u5f00\u5fc3\u3002"], ["Life hasn't exactly been a barrel of laughs lately.", "\u6700\u8fd1\u751f\u6d3b\u5e76\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u4ee4\u4eba\u5f00\u5fc3\u3002"], ["They've got us over a barrel.
