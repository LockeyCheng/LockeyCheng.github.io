He is now in self-exile, living in Washington, DC, fearing that he will be arrested for his political views if he returns to his country.\u00a0\n \n Unlike other figures the Saudi authorities have targeted, such as the writer Raif Badawi, who was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">allegedly</span> \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">insult</span>ing Islam\u201d, Mr Khashoggi is hardly a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dissident</span>. Before he left, he was generally seen as close with the royal court, and even today describes the idea of regime change as \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridiculous</span>\u201d. Mr Khashoggi\u2019s troubles began after he gave a \n \n  to an American think-tank shortly after Donald Trump\u2019s shocking <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">presidential</span> victory. He argued that Saudi Arabia should be \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rightfully</span> nervous about a Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">presidency</span>\u201d at a time when the kingdom was cosying up to the president-elect. Shortly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thereafter</span>, he was informed by Saudi officials that he could no longer write or tweet. After hearing stories of friends and colleagues prevented from leaving the country and even <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">imprison</span>ed, he decided to leave.\n \n <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Muhammad</span> bin Salman, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crown</span> price, has an ambitious agenda to reform his country\u2019s oil-dependent economy. He has turned Western heads by loosening his kingdom\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stiff</span> social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">restriction</span>s, most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">notably</span> by lifting the ban on female driving. At the same time, he has ramped up his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suppress</span>ion of political freedoms and the ability to voice <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dissent</span>. The kingdom has \n \n  the owners of Saudi media <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">outlet</span>s and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">extract</span>ed <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concession</span>s in exchange for their freedom. Many of the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prominent</span> female activists, such as Lujain al-Hathloul, who lobbied for the right to drive, now find themselves in jail. Saudi journalists who have contacts with foreign embassies risk being labelled as \n \n . The country already scores among the worst in the world on its free-press protections. Despite the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crown</span> prince\u2019s youth and courting of the West, that seems unlikely to change.\n \n Mr Khashoggi sat down with \n \n  to give his thoughts on the state of free expression in Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East. Our <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transcript</span>, presented below, has been lightly edited for clarity.\n \n ***\n \n : It was around this time last year. It was Ramadan, and usually we Saudis\u2014and as someone from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Medina</span>\u2014I would have loved to spend this time in Saudi Arabia, in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Medina</span> during Ramadan. But I did not feel comfortable. I was nervous.\n \n I was banned from writing. I was banned from tweeting at that time.\n \n  They did not give me a reason when they ordered me to go <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">silent</span>. But it all started after I spoke at the Washington Institute [for Near East Policy], and I said Saudi Arabia should not be comfortable with the election of Donald Trump. If they did not like [Barack] Obama for not supporting the Saudi <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stance</span> in Syria, they should expect the same from Trump because of Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. The Washington Institute <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quote</span>d me as saying that. And I learned later from a close <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">acquaintance</span> at the royal court that they were afraid that me speaking might hurt talks then <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">underway</span> with the Trump team. It was really <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridiculous</span> because I was just a journalist.\n \n [...] Then the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Qatari</span> crisis broke out, and the Saudi media went into a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">frenzy</span>. The Saudis who were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">silent</span> were accused of being <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">traitor</span>s. That made me feel like I better leave just to be safe. So I packed my stuff and I left for America. When I left, I had no plan to speak out. I just wanted to be safe. I was afraid of getting banned from traveling, because I was hearing of people getting banned. So I thought: \u201cGet out while you can, before it is too late.\u201d\n \n After I arrived in Washington, things began to happen in Saudi Arabia. Arrests\u2026\n \n  The big arrests [of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prominent</span> princes and businessmen like al-Waleed bin Talal who were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">detain</span>ed in the Ritz-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Carlton</span> hotel in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Riyadh</span>]. And many of my friends were arrested.\n \n  Journalist friends, activists, social-media personalities, ordinary friends who I knew, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">acquaintance</span>s. What is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">annoy</span>ing is that there was no reason. And I think when you get arrested for doing nothing, it is more painful that way. Now eight months after the arrests of those guys last September, they <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">haven</span>\u2019t been charged with anything! Many of them spent months in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">solitary</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">confinement</span>.\n \n A brother of one of them called me and said you will not believe what I have been through. This brother visited him and found him so broken. We are talking about economists, intellectuals, writers. We are not talking about criminals who are used to a tough life. People like you and me. If you ended up in jail, it could break you\u2014especially in your own country.\n \n  I\u2019m in self-exile. I don\u2019t see myself as opposition. I just want to be an independent writer, and that is what I\u2019m doing with the \n \n  [where Mr Khashoggi is a contributor]. I\u2019m just writing my views assuming that I am Saudi <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Arabian</span>.\u00a0\n \n I am writing a forthcoming piece in which I suggest why <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Muhammad</span> bin Salman [the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crown</span> prince of Saudi Arabia] needs a free press. In it, I <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">propose</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Kuwait</span>i publication law as a model. In <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Kuwait</span>, even though it is a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">monarchy</span>, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Kuwait</span>i media has more room to debate and check and balance the government. But they do not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">criticize</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">emir</span>.\u00a0\n \n  I think it\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reasonable</span>. I\u2019m not an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">extremist</span>. And I disagree with Saudis who are calling for regime change and stuff like that. It\u2019s just <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridiculous</span>. We don\u2019t need that in Saudi Arabia. I believe in the system\u2014I just want a reformed system. Actually, I want the system to give me a voice to allow me to speak.\n \n  Yes, yes of course. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Kuwait</span> has that, why can\u2019t we? Jordan has that, why can\u2019t we? <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Morocco</span> has that, why can\u2019t we?\n \n  I will not return because I don\u2019t want to risk losing my freedom. I really don\u2019t like being in jail. I don\u2019t want to struggle and be the shining example. I just want to be a free writer. I think I am serving my country and my people by providing an independent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">narrative</span>.\n \n I often get attacked in Saudi Arabia, but the critics don\u2019t <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridicule</span> my ideas. There were about 30 or 40 articles attacking me in the Saudi press. Not a single one debated something I wrote. They just <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridicule</span>d me as a person. They see me as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">traitor</span> who is writing in the foreign press. But discuss what I am writing? They will not.\n \n  Egypt is a mess. There is totally no freedom, but they are making a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mockery</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">journalism</span> in Egypt. In Egypt a journalist lies. Or the government tells people to lie and engage in conspiracies. If you were working a news agency, you cannot trust anything you read in Egyptian newspapers, you cannot trust any number.\n \n And this is very sad because Egypt is the mother of Arab <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">journalism</span>. But in the Arab world, the countries where you can find decent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">journalism</span> is entirely related to the extent of freedom there: <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Tunisia</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Morocco</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Kuwait</span>, and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Lebanon</span> except for the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">intimidation</span> of Hizbullah. In <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Lebanon</span> there is some freedom, but of course Hizbullah is intimidating journalists who dare to go after them.\u00a0\n \n  It\u2019s very controlled. In Saudi Arabia, in the UAE. Sometimes the government plays a very interesting game, in which you are allowed to criticise or to debate an issue in another country but not your own. Again, this is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridiculous</span>.\u00a0\n \n  Yes. I can imagine a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Qatari</span> newspaper talking about the badly managed economic policy in Egypt. But they will not talk about the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wasteful</span> cost of building in Qatar, which I find <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hypocritical</span> but we do it in the Arab world. I did it, when I was an editor in a newspaper. It is like that old joke about <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Brezhnev</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Eisenhower</span>. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Eisenhower</span> tells <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Brezhnev</span>, \u201cIn America, anyone can criticise me openly.\u201d And <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Brezhnev</span> says \u201cYes, we have the same thing in Russia. Anyone can criticise the American president openly.\u201d\n \n  Particularly at this time, it is not right. Why? The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crown</span> price is engaging in a major economic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transformation</span>. And since there is no one to debate it, to discuss it, he will not see the faults of those <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transformation</span>s. For example, he <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">orchestrate</span>d the spending of tens of billions of dollars in building an entertainment city south of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Riyadh</span>. There was not a single article debating the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">feasibility</span> of this project. When you build a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">metro</span> line in Washington, DC, you debate whether it is a smart decision or not.\n \n  It was an assistant to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crown</span> prince. I got the phone call from the royal court. I couldn\u2019t debate it, there was no court order.
