class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">coming</span> to an end\n \n Financial-technology firms are putting a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeeze</span> on banks and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureaux</span> de change\n \n SOME years ago, when Gulliver was a wide-eyed reporter on his first business trip, he <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sidled</span> up to a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureau</span> de change in London\u2019s Heathrow Airport to buy some foreign currency. His nervous excitement quickly turned to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dismay</span> when the teller <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gouged</span> 12% from the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transaction</span>, justifying the theft by tapping on a display-screen of ruinous exchange rates. Today, Gulliver knows better than to buy foreign currency at an airport. But many do not: in 2016 Heathrow <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">raked</span> in \u00a350m ($68m) by renting retail space to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureaux</span> de change. New technology and startups could soon change that. \n Savvier travellers have, until now, bought their foreign currency in advance from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureaux</span> de change outside the airport. Higher competition and lower costs mean that these firms trade closer to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interbank</span> exchange rate\u2013the price at which two currencies are actually <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">swapped</span> by financial institutions. Yet all <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">middlemen</span> need a mark up, so they still add a margin of 2-5% to their commission <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quotes</span>. \n A new breed of challenger banks\u201d wants to bring that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">racket</span> to an end. Revolut, a financial-technology (or fin startup that operates solely through its mobile app, is leading the charge. Like a traditional bank, it gives customers a British current account and a pre-paid <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">debit</span> card. Unlike one, it offers live <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interbank</span> exchange rates for overseas <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transactions</span> that users can lock in on the app. Other fin-tech rivals are also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeezing</span> the margins that traditional firms charge. TransferWise, for example, charges six times less for international cash <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transfers</span> than Santander, a high-street bank. That is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ominous</span> for the old guard. Profits from this part of Santander\u2019s business amounted to \u20ac585m ($647m) in 2016. \n Revolut and TransferWise are just two fish in a growing pond of startups aiming to upset the established order of Britain\u2019s retail <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">banking</span> sector. Other newcomers, such as Monzo and Starling Bank, focus on domestic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transactions</span> rather than foreign exchange. All appeal to younger generations through their digital apps, which are cheaper to run than bricks-and banks and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureaux</span> de change. \n Of course, finance is not the only industry <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">grappling</span> with digital <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">disruption</span>. Hoteliers and taxi firms used to abuse their position just as banks do, until Airbnb, a website for booking overnight stays in other people\u2019s homes, and Uber, a ride-hailing app, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exposed</span> them to greater competition. The banks and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureaux</span> de change can take <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">comfort</span> from the fact that old habits die hard. Some travellers will still need to buy physical currency when before they travel abroad, which generally attracts higher handling costs and commission margins than digital money.
