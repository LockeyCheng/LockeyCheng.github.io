"Scotland introduces a minimum price of 50p per unit of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alcohol\n</span> \n But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overhauling</span> taxes would be a more effective way to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">curb</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">excessive</span> boozing\n \n ON MAY 1st Scotland introduced a minimum price of 50p ($0. per unit of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alcohol</span>, which is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">equivalent</span> to roughly half a pint of beer or a small glass of wine, making it one of a handful of countries to have such a policy. The measure, which was passed by the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">devolved</span> Scottish <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span> in 2012 but has been delayed by legal challenges from the drinks industry, is designed to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">curb</span> a nation-wide problem. In 2016 7, Britons died of causes related to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alcohol</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consumption;</span> the rate in Scotland is nearly double the national average. \n The effect on prices will be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">substantial</span>. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) a think-tank, some 70% of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alcohol</span> bought in British shops falls below the 50p-per <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threshold</span>. The IFS has <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">simulated</span> the effects of such a policy across Britain, using tax and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alcohol</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consumption</span> data from 2011 (which have been adjusted to current prices) Lovers of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scrumpy</span> apple brews will be particularly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dismayed</span>. Cider has historically been taxed at lower rates than other types of drink as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concession</span> to British apple farmers, who sell half of their produce for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">booze</span>. With a 50p <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threshold</span>, however, the price of Tesco three-litre dry-bottled <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cider</span>, the most popular of its kind, would double. \n Scotland\u2019s policy is likely to pay off. When the IFS forecasted the results of a nationwide 45p <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threshold</span> from the 2011 data, it found an increase in social welfare of \u00a3830m per year, caused largely by the reduced social costs of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">excessive</span> drinking. Yet the better option was to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overhaul</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alcohol</span> duties, which could increase social welfare by \u00a31. Following European Union rules, Britain currently taxes wine and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cider</span> by the total volume of a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">beverage</span>, rather than the number of units it contains, which makes stronger drinks relatively cheaper. The IFS\u2019 proposed tax system would generally target the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">punchiest</span> products, in the hope of nudging problem drinkers onto softer <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tipples</span>. The price of weaker spirits, such as Baileys <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">liqueur</span>, would actually fall. \n Raising taxes, rather than hiking prices, has the added benefit of directing the extra revenue to public finances which can be invested in healthcare, rather than lining brewers\u2019 pockets. The Scottish government, unfortunately, has no power to do so\u2014and the British government is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reluctant</span> to upset voters by making their favourite vice more expensive."}
