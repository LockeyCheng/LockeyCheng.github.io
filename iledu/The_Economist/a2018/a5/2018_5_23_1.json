{"date": "2018-05-23 By Lockey.", "content": "\n The administration plans to cut funding for family-planning <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clinic</span>s that also perform <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">termination</span>s\n \n THE best way to prevent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s is to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Family-planning <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clinic</span>s, which provide <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contraception</span>, are good at that. In the past four decades they have helped slash America\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span> rate. Yet on May 19th President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said it would begin the process of curbing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s by cutting funding to some <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clinic</span>s. This is obviously self-defeating.\n \n The administration plans to introduce a new rule under which <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clinic</span>s that provide <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s, as well as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contraception</span>, would lose federal funding through \u201cTitle X\u201d, a federal grant programme for family-planning. The rule wouldn\u2019t prevent federal money being used for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s. That is already banned, in almost all cases, by the so-called Hyde <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Amendment</span>, a measure that has been passed annually by Congress for the past 40 years. Instead, the administration means to cut Title X funding to any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clinic</span> that provides <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s\u2014or even refers women to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span> providers.\n \n The move is intended to fulfil one of Mr Trump\u2019s campaign promises: to \u201cdefund\u201d Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span>, an organisation that provides family planning services to about 40% of the 4m Americans covered by Title X. Because Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span> is also America\u2019s biggest provider of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s\u2014about half its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clinic</span>s perform <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">termination</span>s\u2014<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> lawmakers have long called for it to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stripped</span> of federal funds. Last year they tried to tie such a move to a failed effort to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">repeal</span> Obamacare.\n \n Pro-life campaigners, an important section of Mr Trump\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">coalition</span>, are cock-a-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hoop</span>. Marjorie Dannenfelser, the Roman <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Catholic</span> president of the Susan N. Antony List, a pro-life campaign group, said the president had delivered, \u201con a key promise to pro-life voters who worked so hard to elect him\u201d. But it is difficult to see who, in reality, this will benefit. It will certainly not be the 2.5m mostly-poor women who use Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span>\u2019s services, which also include testing for STIs and cancer-screening. In some parts of America, groups that perform <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s are the only federally-funded providers of family-planning services.\n \n Defunding Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span> won\u2019t save money, either. The organisation\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">provision</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contraceptive</span>s prevent unwanted pregnancies, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s and sexually-transmitted diseases, which are a lot more expensive to care for, carry out and treat than <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prophylactic</span>s. The Guttmacher Institute, an NGO, has estimated that for every public dollar spent on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contraception</span>, the government saves more than five dollars in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Medicaid</span> spending on pregnancies.\n \n The administration knows this, of course. In a recently-published <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">memoir</span>, Cecile Richards, Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span>\u2019s former president, described how Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, came to her with a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proposal</span>: if Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span> would stop providing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s, the federal government would give it more funding. Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dismiss</span>ed the idea.\n \n Some <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> lawmakers, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conceivably</span> including Mr Trump, appear so sickened by Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span>\u2019s record of providing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>s that they would do anything, however self-defeating, to close it down. Yet the main reason they have made it such a target is because they have few alternative means to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">satiate</span> the pro-life demands of their voters\u2014including around a quarter of Republicans who vote largely on the basis of this issue. \n \n  the Supreme Court ruling that in 1973 established women\u2019s right to an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>, is unlikely to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overturn</span>ed any time soon. A ban on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span> after 20 weeks, which made it through the House of Representatives, failed in the Senate. Mr Trump has been a champion of the pro-life cause since he became president, but has no serious <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospect</span> of ending <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span>.\n \n Of course, the new rule is likely energise those on the other side of the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span> debate too. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Dawn</span> Laguens, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> vice-president of Planned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Parenthood</span>, which is likely to mount a legal challenge to the new rule, warned that it \"would have devastating <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consequence</span>s across the country\". Democrats, including an unusually large number of women candidates campaigning for the mid-terms, are already seizing on this. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">senator</span> Kirsten Gillibrand, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Democratic</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">senator</span>, told CNN that she expected it to \u201cenrage the American public, particularly women, because it's an attack on them\u201d.\u00a0", "last": "2018_5_22_1.json", "next": "2018_5_23_2.json", "assistent": {"senator": {"pron": {"peg": "['s\u025bn\u0259t\u025a]", "pam": "['s\u025bn\u0259t\u025a]"}, "wp": {"SPA SENATOR": "\u53c2\u8bae\u5458\u6e29\u6cc9\u9152\u5e97", "Senator Norma": "\u53c2\u8bae\u5458\u8bfa\u739b", "Junior Senator": "\u8d44\u6d45\u53c2\u8bae\u5458", "Senator Reed": "\u5458\u91cc\u5fb7", "Senator Brown": "\u5e03\u6717", "en senator": "\u53c2\u8bae\u9662", "Senator Line": "\u5fb7\u56fd\u80dc\u5229\u822a\u8fd0;\u5fb7\u56fd\u80dc\u5229\u822a\u8fd0\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8", "Senator Roark": "\u4e07\u6076\u57ce\u5e02", "State Senator": "\u5dde\u53c2\u8bae\u5458;\u53c2\u8bae\u9662"}, "ex": ["n. \u53c2\u8bae\u5458\uff1b\uff08\u53e4\u7f57\u9a6c\u7684\uff09\u5143\u8001\u9662\u8bae\u5458\uff1b\u8bc4\u8bae\u5458\uff0c\u7406\u4e8b", "n.
