{"next": "2018_5_5_4.json", "content": "Binyamin Netanyahu tries to convince Donald Trump to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scuttle</span> the Iran deal\n \n But he has presented no evidence that Iran is violating the agreement\n \n IT WAS one of the most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hyped</span> PowerPoint <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">presentations</span> in history. Game changing\u201d very significant\u201d and dramatic\u201d was how aides to Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, described it. To many viewers, it did not disappoint. On April 30th Mr Netanyahu (pictured) <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unveiled</span> 55, pages stolen by Israeli spies, fully half a ton of material related to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. He showed off photographs of test devices and blueprints of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">warheads</span>. The secret atomic archive\u201d proved beyond any doubt, said Mr Netanyahu, that Iran had for years sought to develop nuclear weapons. \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">presentation</span> seemed aimed at an audience of one: President Donald Trump, who must decide by May 12th whether to pull America out of a deal under which Iran agreed to halt its nuclear-weapons programme in return for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sanctions</span> relief. Other <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatories</span>, including Britain, France and Germany, have tried to convince Mr Trump to stay in the agreement. They have worked with America to try to fix what the president regards as the deal\u2019s fatal flaws. But Mr Netanyahu said that the deal was based on lies\u201d and, therefore, never should have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">struck</span>. \n The problem with Mr Netanyahu\u2019s argument is that nearly all of the information he presented had been documented by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before 2015. Despite Iran\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protestations</span> that its nuclear programme had only ever been for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">civilian</span> use, the IAEA and Western governments had little doubt that its aim was to get nuclear weapons. American intelligence agencies <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concluded</span> that Iran <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suspended</span> much of its bomb-making activity in 2003, though some elements continued. Indeed, it was because of this that America and others pursued the nuclear deal. \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatories</span> did not insist that Iran admit everything it had done in the past, because that might have scuppered the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">negotiations</span>. Instead they <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fudged</span> it and ensured that Iran\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">untrustworthiness</span> was reflected in an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">obligation</span> to open itself up to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unprecedented</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inspections</span> by the IAEA. \n Critics, including Mr Netanyahu and Mr Trump, say that the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inspections</span> of military sites leave the Iranians <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ample</span> time to hide nuclear-weapons material. They also complain that the deal does not cover Iran\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ballistic</span>-missile programme, which has continued since 2015, and that it allows <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constraints</span> on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme to eventually expire\u2014at which time it might use the old blueprints to build a bomb. \n Yet few argue that the deal is not currently effective. Mr Netanyahu failed to present any proof that Iran is violating the agreement. None of the material obtained by Israel\u2019s spies <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pertains</span> to the period since it was signed. In an interview in March, the chief of staff of Israel\u2019s armed forces, Gadi Eizenkot, said, Right now the agreement, with all its faults, is working and is putting off <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">realisation</span> of the Iranian nuclear vision by ten to 15 years. \n Critics have struggled to come up with an alternative, short of military strikes, that would contain Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Still, the White House seems determined to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scrap</span> the deal. It said Mr Netanyahu <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">provided</span> new and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compelling</span> details about Iran\u2019s efforts to develop missile-deliverable nuclear weapons. \n Israel is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">confronting</span> Iran in other areas, too. Mr Netanyahu\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">presentation</span> came less than a day after missile strikes on targets in Syria killed over a dozen people, many of them Iranians. Suspicion has fallen on Israel, which has hit Iranian bases in Syria in the past. Analysts worry that increasing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">friction</span> between the countries could eventually lead to an all-out war. The unravelling of the nuclear deal has <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">heightened</span> such fears.  \n", "keywords":
