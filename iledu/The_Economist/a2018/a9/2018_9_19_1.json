It would offer respected, cheap <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">qualification</span>s to students lacking the exam results or freedom to attend other universities. Despite scepticism at the time, it became the largest university in Europe, and is considered one of the great success stories of 20th-century higher education.\u00a0\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Today, it is in a ropey state. Student numbers have fallen from 260,000 in 2009-10 to 174,000 in 2016-17. The university has lost its place at the top of the student-<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">satisfaction</span> rankings, partly as a result of the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">botch</span>ed introduction of a new computer system. The main causes of the university\u2019s problems are changes to the student-finance regime. In 2012 the English government doubled the cap on part-time <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">tuition</span> fees to \u00a36,750 ($8,810) a year and cut back on the cash it gave the OU per student, meaning the university had little choice but to raise prices. Since applying for loans imposes an extra layer of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">bureaucracy</span>, and since many older students do not qualify for government support, numbers have fallen sharply. And the increasing ease of access to higher education means that today, by the age of 30, half of the population has been to university, compared with one in 12 in 1970.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p> Read more
