The World Bank says it is one of only a very small number to have seen no reduction in recent years; the rate has even risen slightly. The country\u2019s minimum legal age of marriage for girls is 15, but some <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">bride</span>s are as young as nine.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Across Africa child marriage <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">stubbornly</span> <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">persist</span>s. Of the roughly 700m women living today who were married before they were 18, 125m are African. Among poor rural families the rate has not <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">budge</span>d since 1990.
