Economic growth will suffer as a result\n \n THE message to markets could not have been clearer. On the morning of May 4th, following a run on the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peso</span>, Argentina\u2019s central bank raised interest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> by 6. percentage points, its third <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hike</span> in a week. The interest rate now stands at 40%, up from 27. on April 27th. \n Across town Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">treasury</span> minister, told reporters that Argentina\u2019s budget <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deficit</span>, which was 3. in 2017, would be brought down to 2. this year, rather than the previously stated target of 3. After the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">announcements</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peso</span> strengthened by nearly 5% against the dollar. \n The combined measures slammed the brakes on what was looking like the start of an escalating crisis. Argentina\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peso</span> had fallen by a fifth against the dollar since the beginning of the year, making it the worst-performing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">emerging</span>-market currency. But the measures also harm the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospects</span> of growth\u2014and of Mauricio Macri, the president. \n The problems began in January, following the central bank\u2019s decision on December 28th to loosen its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> target for 2018 from 12% to 15%. The decision was taken at the behest of the government, which was concerned about the impact of high interest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> on economic growth. The bank then <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">eased</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> by 0. percentage points, causing expectations of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> to rise. Investors began to question the bank\u2019s independence, and its commitment to reducing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span>. \n Their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">jitters</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">intensified</span> after 10-year US <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">treasury</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">yields</span> rose above 3 per cent in late April. That <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prompted</span> investors to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">withdraw</span> money from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">emerging</span> markets and other risky assets. Argentina was first in line. On top of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> that has run at 25% over the past 12 months, investors were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spooked</span> by the country\u2019s large foreign debt pile and a current-account <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deficit</span> of 5% of GDP. \n Political decisions within Argentina <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exacerbated</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">external</span> shock. Foreign investors became <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">keener</span> still to sell Argentine bonds and buy dollars when the government brought in a new capital-gains tax in order to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">appease</span> its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">opponents</span>. Political tensions within Cambiemos, the governing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">coalition</span>, over how quickly to reduce <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">subsidies</span> for energy and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">utility</span> bills cast doubt on the government\u2019s commitment to cut spending. \n In the final week of April, faced with a rapidly weakening <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peso</span>, and fearing the impact of the currency\u2019s slide on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span>, the central bank sold $4. of its dollar reserves over five days. Between April 27th and May 3rd it raised interest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> by six percentage points. But the moves had little effect. After the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peso</span> lost 7. of its value during trading on May 3rd, the bank <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">decided</span> to act more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">forcefully</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hiking</span> the interest rate up to 40%. \n The measure appears to have averted a full-blown crisis, at least for now. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, says Alberto Ramos of Goldman Sachs, an investment bank. Panic appears to have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">receded</span>. But Argentina may not be out of the woods. The central bank will be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">braced</span> for further <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">downward</span> pressure on the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peso</span>, particularly if <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> figures continue to disappoint. \n That means interest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> will probably remain high for some time. If the central bank cuts <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> too early we risk seeing a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rerun</span> of the crisis we\u2019ve just seen, says Edward Glossop of Capital Economics, a consultancy. On May 4th Fitch, a ratings agency, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">downgraded</span> the outlook for Argentina from positive to stable, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">citing</span> high <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> and economic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">volatility</span>. \n With presidential elections not due until October 2019, Mr Macri has time to steady the ship. He had hoped the country\u2019s economic situation would begin to pick up during the second half of the year, when <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> was expected to fall and the real value of wages was expected to rise. But a severe <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">drought</span> meant that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospect</span> was already <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">receding</span>. Higher interest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span>, and the extra <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fiscal</span> tightening <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">announced</span> on May 4th, dim it even more, says Mr Glossop. \n Mr Macri, and the central bank, are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">desperately</span> trying to ensure that Argentina avoids repeating the experience of Brazil, which only got a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">grip</span> on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> after the longest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">recession</span> in its history. Will it take a big hit to the economy to finally break the back of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span>? asks Mr Ramos. Argentines must hope not. \n \u00a0", "assistent": {"rerun": {"eg2": [], "ex": ["vi. \u518d\u8fd0\u884c\uff1b\u518d\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6f14\uff1b\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u52a8", "vt.
