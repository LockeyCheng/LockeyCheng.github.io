{"last": "2018_4_19_3.json", "date": "2018-04-20 By Lockey.", "content": "Credit where credit isn't due Americans will no longer have to sign for credit-card purchases\n \n But the move will do nothing to help security\n \n AMERICANS, and people who travel to America, have good reason to celebrate this month. By the end of April, the four major credit-card networks in the country will all stop requiring retailers to collect <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatures</span> from customers when completing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transactions</span>. Visa, the world\u2019s biggest credit-card <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">issuer</span> announced in January that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatures</span> would no longer be required from month for retailers in North America with chip card readers. For Mastercard, the world\u2019s second largest, the same change became effective on April 13th, covering purchases in the United States and Canada. American Express, in third place globally, is dropping the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signature</span> requirement this month for retailers around the world. Discover, the fourth, is doing so in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. \n Although retailers will have the option of continuing to make customers sign, many have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signalled</span> they will not do so. Big retail chains such as Walmart and Target have said they will put an end to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatures</span>. Mark Horwedel, the chief <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> of the Merchant Advisory Group, which <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">represents</span> major American retailers, told the New York Times, a newspaper, that he expects around 75% to do away with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatures</span> by the end of 2018. Already, the credit-card companies do not require <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatures</span> for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transactions</span> under a certain amount, but soon at most stores they will be gone <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">altogether</span>. \n For travellers to these countries, the move is good news. The random <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scribbles</span> that are applied to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">receipts</span> and digital screens have long <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ceased</span> to protect purchasers from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fraud</span>. All they really do is slow down the check-out process, causing longer lines and raising costs for retailers. \n But to Europeans, the news will surely seem slightly puzzling. All the way back in 1994, Visa, Mastercard, and Europay developed a standard for credit cards with a computer chip. Soon chip-and purchases were common across Europe. Rather than verifying their identities with a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signature</span>, customers inserted their chip cards into readers and then entered secret PIN codes. \n But as The Verge, a news website, has documented, America resisted the change. Fraud was not terribly common, but <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">magnetic</span>-strip credit cards were everywhere, and it would have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complicated</span> and expensive to replace them with chip cards. (This will sound familiar to anyone who wonders why America has not joined the rest of the world in adopting the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">metric</span> system. It was not until 2015 that Visa and Mastercard started <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">penalising</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">issuers</span> who did not put chips in their cards, causing Americans finally to adopt them. \n The move this month away from chip-and does not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">imply</span> a switch to the more secure chip-and Instead, America will adopt chip-and well, nothing. The announcement by the credit-card <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">issuers</span> to drop the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signature</span> requirement is an admission that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signatures</span> did not really prevent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fraud</span>. But they do not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">purport</span> that abandoning them makes things safer. Once Americans have grown <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accustomed</span> to the speed and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">convenience</span> of making credit card <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transactions</span> without any sort of identity <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">verification</span>, it might become a lot harder to persuade them to adopt the more time-consuming\u2014but more secure\u2014chip-and system. \n Still, relative to the current system, the change will be a welcome one for anyone doing business in the United States. Just be sure to check your credit-card statements <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">periodically</span> to make sure that no purchases appear on them that are not your own. As in so many things, there\u2019s a price to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">convenience</span>.", "keywords":
