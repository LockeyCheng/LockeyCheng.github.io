{"date": "2018-06-29 07:23:36", "content": "\n For some, it is an outmoded way to travel\n \n ![Why fewer people use public transport](https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/20180630_BLP504.jpg) \n IN MUCH of the rich world, urban public transport is becoming <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quieter</span>. New York\u2019s subway carried 2% fewer people on weekdays over the last 12 months than it did the year before, and the city\u2019s buses were 6% less busy. London\u2019s \u201cTube\u201d dipped unexpectedly, too. This is a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">puzzle</span>. After all, most large cities are growing in population. Employment is often rising even more quickly. Urbanites have jobs to go to\u2014and, because they have jobs, money to spend in shops and restaurants. But they are not taking trains or buses as much as they used to.\u00a0\n \n Cities have noticed the trend, and they have plenty of excuses for it. Some point out that service levels on public transport have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">worsen</span>ed. Delays are up in some cities, either because too little is being spent on public transport or because (in New York, for example) it is being spent on beautiful stations rather than on signals that work. Others say that buses are being slowed by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">roadwork</span>s, making them less appealing. A few cities, such as Paris, have suffered terrorist attacks, which could have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scare</span>d people off public transport. In still others, ticket prices have risen.\u00a0\n \n These excuses are probably not enough to explain a widespread decline. Even in cities where public transport is much better than it was (Los Angeles, for example) passenger numbers have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slump</span>ed. It seems more likely that public transport is being <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeeze</span>d <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">structurally</span>, from two directions. First, people\u2019s need to travel is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">diminish</span>ing as a result of smartphones, video-conferencing, online shopping and so on. Second, urbanites now have more and better options for getting around. Uber is already <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ubiquitous</span>; easy-to-rent dockless bicycles are spreading; battery-powered scooters will be next. When driverless taxis appear in cities, as they eventually should, public transport will come to seem even less appealing. For now, driving is easier than it was because car loans have become so cheap.\u00a0\n \n Public transport is in some ways the opposite of driving. When more people drive, the roads become <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clogged</span>, delays go up, and driving becomes less appealing. When more people use buses or trains, by contrast, the service usually improves because public-transport agencies run more buses and trains. Until recently many wealthy cities were in that happy loop. Now the pattern has reversed. If the decline in passengers continues, cities could be pulled into a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">downward</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spiral</span> of fewer passengers and worse service. Some of the shine has already come off public transport. In May, voters in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Nashville</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overwhelmingly</span> rejected a plan to raise taxes to pay for a larger public-transport system. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Opponent</span>s of the scheme had not just argued (as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Opponent</span>s usually do) that new taxes are bad. They had also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assert</span>ed that public transport is outmoded. The future, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">apparently</span>, is driverless cars.\n \n  (June 21st 2018)", "last": "2018_6_28_6.json", "next": "2018_6_29_2.json", "assistent": {"Nashville": {"ex":
