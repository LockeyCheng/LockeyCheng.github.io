{"Date": "2019-01-15 14:21:33", "content": "<p>\n</p> <p>Donald Trump has shut down the government in a bid to wall off the border. But the number of people crossing peaked long ago\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>AMERICA\u2019S GOVERNMENT has now been shut down for nearly a month over Donald Trump\u2019s <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">signature</span> campaign promise to build a wall along the United States-Mexico border. Mr Trump says a wall is needed in order to stop people pouring into the country illegally. In fact, the tide had slowed long before he made his <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">pledge</span>. The number of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">apprehension</span>s of people attempting to cross the border illegally peaked in 2000, when America\u2019s Border Patrol made more than 1.6m arrests, over 98% of which were of Mexicans. By Barack Obama\u2019s term in office, <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">apprehension</span>s had fallen to an average of just 400,000 a year\u2014about where they stood in 2018. In 2017, the last year for which data on migrants\u2019 country of origin were available, only 42% of the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">apprehension</span>s involved Mexicans.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Counting arrests does not necessarily <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">yield</span> a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">reliable</span> <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">estimate</span> of the number of border-crossers who manage to <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">evade</span> <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">detection</span>. The authorities\u2019 success at catching illegal immigrants can vary; they may wind up <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">detain</span>ing the same people multiple times. Nonetheless, the Pew <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Hispanic</span> Centre, a research organisation, <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">estimate</span>s that the total who do make it through has fallen as well, to less than a third of its peak level.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>The causes of this decline are open to debate. In the early 2000s Republican politicians from border states lobbied the federal government to build a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">fence</span>. In response, Congress authorised the construction of 700 miles (1,125 km) of fencing in 2006, covering about a third of the total distance from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico; 548 miles of fencing were eventually built. Whether it is responsible for the trend of falling arrests is contested. The only region that has seen an uptick in the past decade is the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Rio</span> Grande Valley, which contains fencing on part but not all of its slice of the border. But arrests have also <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">dwindle</span>d in areas without a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">fence</span> at all. A deep <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">recession</span> and the end of America\u2032s housing boom, which created large numbers of construction jobs, surely played an important role in subduing immigration. A recent analysis found the existing wall reduced the number of Mexican citizens living in America by just 0.6% (see  article ).\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Mr Trump harbours no doubts about the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">efficacy</span> of physical barriers. He signed an <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">executive</span> order authorising construction of a border wall on his fifth day in office. He now demands that Congress put up $5.7bn for its construction, and has previously threatened to declare a national <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">emergency</span> on the border to get his way. If the numbers are anything to go by, any <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">emergency</span> is long past.</p>", "Last": "2019_1_15_3.json", "Next": "2019_1_15_5.json", "assistent": {"Hispanic": {"ex":
