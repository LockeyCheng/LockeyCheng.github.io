{"Date": "2019-01-31 10:07:59", "content": "<p>\n</p> <p>American firms lead the way, despite political <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">setback</span>s\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>THE <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">PROSPECT</span> for America\u2019s carbon <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">footprint</span> looked <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">bleak</span> after Donald Trump <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">withdrew</span> from the Paris Agreement in 2017. A tax on imported solar panels, coupled with the winding down of federal tax credits for both solar and wind, inspired little in the way of hope.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Despite the administration\u2019s lack of support, American companies are leading the way when it comes to reducing carbon <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">emission</span>s. One of the ways they are doing this is through power-purchase agreements (PPAs), where they buy clean power straight from independent <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">generator</span>s.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Data released this week by Bloomberg New Energy Finance show that corporate demand throughout the world, but particularly in America, has boomed. Companies worldwide signed a record 13.4GW worth of clean-energy <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">contract</span>s in 2018, more than double the amount the year before (see first chart). American companies accounted for more than 60% of this total.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Tech firms have played a part. Facebook purchased a whopping 2.6GW in 2018, and Google made headlines last year when it matched 100% of its annual <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">electricity</span> <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">consumption</span> with <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">renewable</span>-energy purchases. Firms outside Silicon Valley have also started to <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">dip</span> their toes in the PPA pond. AT&T was the second-largest buyer of clean-energy PPAs last year, and ExxonMobil became the first large oil company to sign one.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Companies have started to club together. RE100, an alliance of companies that includes Facebook and Apple, has 161 signatories with 100%-<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">renewable</span>-<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">electricity</span> targets. This is ambitious, though. To meet this target, companies will need to purchase an additional 190TWh of clean energy in 2030 (see second chart). The <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">surge</span> in American activity may merely reflect a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">scramble</span> to <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">procure</span> clean energy before the tax credits are phased out. There is still some way to go before companies abandon dirty fuels completely.</p>", "Last": "2019_1_30_4.json", "Next": "2019_1_30_6.json", "assistent": {"PROSPECT": {"ex": ["n.
