{"Date": "2019-06-05 10:36:34", "content": "<p>\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>AT TWENTY-THREE minutes past one in the morning of April 26th 1986, a safety test at a nuclear <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">reactor</span> in Soviet Ukraine went <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">catastrophically</span> wrong. The resulting steam <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">explosion</span> at the plant near the city of Pripyat, 70 miles north of Kiev, <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">spew</span>ed out so much <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">radiation</span> that much of the surrounding area will be <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">uninhabitable</span> for 20,000 years. Harmful <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">isotope</span>s were carried by the winds as far as Ireland within a week. According to some accounts, first responders who were <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">expose</span>d to large <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">dose</span>s of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">radiation</span> suffered agonising deaths. These events, as well as the political <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">intrigue</span> of the Soviet government\u2019s actions, are the subject of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">HBO</span>\u2019s historical drama series, \u201c<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Chernobyl</span>\u201d. Following the final <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span>, which aired in America on June 3rd, it is the highest-rated television series of all time, according to crowd-sourced reviews on IMDb, a film and television rating site.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Reviewers have given the miniseries <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">stellar</span> ratings. A weighted average of all five <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span>s calculated by  The Economist  (according to how recently each <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span> ran and the number of reviews) accords it 9.7 points out of 10. By the same measure, other leading shows\u2014including <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">comparable</span> historical drama series such as \u201cThe <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Crown</span>\u201d and \u201cThe People v. O. J. Simpson\u201d (now called \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d)\u2014<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">lag</span> behind.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>What is more, every <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span> of \u201c<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Chernobyl</span>\u201d has been rated by IMDb users at 9.5 or higher, a unique <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">streak</span>. According to  The Economist \u2019s analysis of 518 <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span>s of popular television dramas, the likelihood that any show would produce even four <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">consecutive</span> <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span>s that each score a 9.5 or above is roughly 0.4%. Apart from \u201c<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Chernobyl</span>\u201d, only the final four <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span>s of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdpreviously the highest-rated show\u2014had <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">accomplish</span>ed this <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">feat</span>.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>All of this is even more <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">impressive</span> given its subject matter. Documentaries <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">typically</span> struggle to gain as much attention as action and fantasy shows such as \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d, and the same is true of historical dramas. Even series about well-known subjects, such as Queen Elizabeth II or the trial of O.J. Simpson, earn user ratings that are <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">typically</span> below those of the most popular shows. In comparison, \u201c<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Chernobyl</span>\u201d scores better than the greats.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>The show has also caused a massive <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">spike</span> in interest about the actual disaster. Web traffic to the entry for the  <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Chernobyl</span> nuclear disaster  on Wikipedia, an online <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">encyclopedia</span>, has increased 56-fold since the start of the year. Interest in a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">comparable</span> nuclear disaster at Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 has also increased, though by a more modest 21 times.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>  Editor\u2019s note (June 4th 2019) : This piece was originally published on June 3rd and has been updated following the airing of the final <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">episode</span> in America. IMDb reviewers gave it a rating of 9.9 out of ten. </p>", "Last": "2019_6_5_12.json", "Next": "2019_6_6_1.json", "assistent": {"Chernobyl": {"ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc
