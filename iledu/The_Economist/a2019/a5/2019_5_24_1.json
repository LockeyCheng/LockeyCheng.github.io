{"Date": "2019-05-24 10:01:39", "content": "<p>\n</p> <p>Young people are <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">pessimistic</span> about the economy, business and their own progress\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>ARE millennials really different from preceding generations? Bartleby tends to be <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">cynical</span> about such claims, recalling how the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">youthful</span> <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">idealism</span> of his own peers was <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">tame</span>d by <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">parenthood</span> and the need to pay the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">mortgage</span>. But a new survey from Deloitte, the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">accountancy</span> firm, suggests that millennials, defined as those born between January 1983 and December 1994, are feeling particularly <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">gloomy</span>. The survey interviewed 13,416 people across 42 countries (with between 200 and 500 people in each nation, ranging from <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Argentina</span> to Turkey).\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>The survey found that climate change was their biggest worry, with 29% concerned about the issue, followed by income equality at 21% (<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">respondent</span>s were asked to pick three issues from a list of 20). That said,  separate research  by MIT found that American millennials travel more miles in cars than baby boomers and are just as keen on car <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">ownership</span>; concern about climate change does not automatically translate into lifestyle changes.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Millennials seem to have turned very <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">pessimistic</span> about the global economy, with only 26% expecting the situation to improve in the next 12 months; that compares with 45% last year. Just over half expect their personal finances to <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">deteriorate</span>. Only 22% expect the social and political climate in their countries to improve, down from 33% in 2018.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>When it comes to business, the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">proportion</span> of millennials who feel that the sector has a positive impact on society has dropped to 55%, from 61% in 2018. Almost two-thirds of those polled think that business have no ambition beyond wanting to make money. In contrast, millennials think businesses should place a higher <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">priority</span> on generating jobs and producing high-quality goods and services.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Many millennials are unhappy with their jobs. The survey says 49% plan to quit within the next two years, up from 38% in 2017. (Of course, younger workers are naturally more <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">footloose</span> than their elders.) <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Dissatisfaction</span> with pay is the biggest factor, followed by a lack of opportunities to advance.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>What about the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">gig</span> economy, which many <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">assume</span> will provide a lot of work for this generation (although it  currently provides just 1% of paid employment  in America)? Here their views are mixed. While 48% think that \"<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">gig</span> workers have a better work/life balance than those in full-time jobs\", 49% think \"the employment rights of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">gig</span> worker are not respected or protected\" and 60% think they are only used to reduce costs.\u00a0\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Finally, there is mixed evidence that \" woke <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">capitalism</span> \" may work, if only in the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">negative</span>. More than a quarter of millennials said they had backed away from an organisation because of its political position, or that of its leader; only around a sixth said they had been positively attracted by a company's position. Sending an <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">illiberal</span> message may drive workers and consumers away.\u00a0</p>", "Last": "2019_5_23_9.json", "Next": "2019_5_24_2.json", "assistent": {"Argentina":
