{"Date": "2019-04-16 09:54:20", "content": "<p>\n</p> <p>Recent opinion surveys show the new Brexit Party is gathering support\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>BRITAIN\u2019S NEW Brexit party has gathered support with <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">remarkable</span> speed. Formed in January 2019, it is already registering double-digit support in opinion polls and has nearly caught up with the UK Independence Party (UKIP), from which it split.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>The new party is headed by <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Nigel</span> Farage, the former leader of UKIP, who successfully pushed the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Conservative</span> party to call a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">referendum</span> on Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union in 2016\u2014and helped the Leave campaign to victory. It was a stunning achievement for what had been regarded as a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">fringe</span> party, and Mr Farage announced his retirement from politics. Now he is back.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Without Mr Farage, UKIP has <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">drift</span>ed ever farther to the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">xenophobic</span> far right under <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">successive</span> leaders. The Brexit Party, for its part, says it aims to draw support from across the political <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">spectrum</span>, from both <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Conservative</span>s and Labour Brexiteers, to ensure that Britain leaves the EU.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>The <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">referendum</span> marked UKIP\u2019s high point. In the general election held in 2017 it received just 1.8% of the votes, down from 12.6% in 2015. Even as it became clear that Brexit\u2014at least as hardline Brexiteers had imagined it\u2014was running into trouble, UKIP still polled only about 4% on average in 2018.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>But <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">populist</span> parties have <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">regain</span>ed <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">momentum</span> since the beginning of this year. The government lost one vote after another on its deal with the EU, and Brexit has been repeatedly delayed. The original deadline of March 29th has been pushed back to October 31st. Unless an agreement is reached soon, Britain will have to hold elections to the European <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Parliament</span> next month, which will be another <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">humiliation</span> for <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Theresa</span> May, the prime minister.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p><span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Populist</span>s and hard Brexiteers accuse members of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Parliament</span> of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">betray</span>ing Brexit. The latest survey gives <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Populist</span> parties a combined vote of 21%. The Brexit Party, which Mr Farage recently described as \u201ca virtual\u201d party, consisting of little more than a website, is just behind UKIP on 10%. Both are ahead of the pro-Remain <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Liberal</span> Democrats on 8% and not far behind the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Conservative</span>s on 14%.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>The contrast between the Brexit party and Change UK, another new party made up of Remainers drawn from Labour and the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Conservative</span>s, does not even figure in the polls despite having lots of favourable press coverage and several <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">prominent</span> MPs. It suffers from a serious branding problem: it faffed around with its name, does not have a leader and failed to present itself as a full-<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">throat</span>ed anti-Brexit Party. It could learn a lesson or two from the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">astute</span> Mr Farage.</p>", "Last": "2019_4_16_4.json", "Next": "2019_4_16_6.json", "assistent": {"Conservative": {"ex": ["adj. \u4fdd\u5b88\u7684", "n. \u4fdd\u5b88\u6d3e\uff0c\u5b88\u65e7\u8005"], "pron": {"peg": "[k\u0259n's\u025dv\u0259t\u026av]", "pam": "[k\u0259n's\u025dv\u0259t\u026av]"}, "st": {}, "wp": {"conservative treatment": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u6cbb\u7597;\u4fdd\u5b88\u7597\u6cd5;\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u6cbb\u7597;\u975e\u624b\u672f\u6cbb\u7597", "conservative recombination": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u91cd\u7ec4;\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u91cd\u7ec4", "conservative property": "\u5b88\u6052\u6027\u8d28;\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027", "Conservative transposition": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u578b\u8f6c\u5ea7;\u4fdd\u5b88\u8f6c\u5ea7;\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u8f6c\u5ea7;\u4fdd\u5b58\u578b\u8f6c\u4f4d", "conservative replacement": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u66ff\u6362", "conservative prediction": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u9884\u6d4b", "conservative field": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u573a", "conservative myomectomy": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u808c\u7624\u6458\u9664\u672f;\u7ffb\u8bd1", "conservative style": "\u4fdd\u5b88\u6b3e\u5f0f"}, "eg2": [["Should I be aggressive or  with my money before 30?", "\u572830\u5c81\u4e4b\u524d\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u8fd8\u662f\u4fdd\u5b88\u5b58\u94b1\uff1f"], ["The more<b> Conservative</b> politicians were trying to deradicalize the liberation movement.", "\u8f83\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u5bb6\u6b63\u8bd5\u56fe\u4f7f\u89e3\u653e\u8fd0\u52a8\u653e\u5f03\u504f\u6fc0\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u3002"], ["The young people are the most eager to learn and the least  in their thinking.", "\u9752\u5e74\u4eba\u6700\u80af\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6700\u5c11\u4fdd\u5b88\u601d\u60f3\u3002"]]}, "Liberal": {"ex": ["adj. \u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\uff1b\u6177\u6168\u7684\uff1b\u4e0d\u62d8\u6ce5\u7684\uff1b\u5bbd\u5927\u7684", "n. \u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005", "n.
