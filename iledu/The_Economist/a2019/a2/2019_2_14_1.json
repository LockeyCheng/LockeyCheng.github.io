The government has said that it aims to reach <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">bilateral</span> agreements with these countries, so that the deals roll over even if Britain leaves the EU on March 29th without a deal. \u201c[P]eople should be <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">reassure</span>d that the government is taking a responsible approach,\u201d it has <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">soothe</span>d.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>But an official document leaked to the Sun newspaper shows that just six deals are on track to meet the end-March deadline. They include one with the Faroe Islands; Faroese-British trade amounts to around \u00a3250m a year (about 0.02% of Britain\u2019s total foreign trade). An agreement with Switzerland that was announced on Monday counts for more.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>Other <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">reasonably</span> big deals with countries like Canada, South Korea and non-EU countries in the European Economic Area such as Norway and Iceland are off track. Sizeable deals with Japan, Turkey and Singapore are simply not possible to conclude by March 29th, according to the leaked document.
