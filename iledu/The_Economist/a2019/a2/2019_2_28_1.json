{"Date": "2019-02-28 15:54:57", "content": "<p>\n</p> <p>In-flight television is fast becoming standard on flights in America\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>\u201cAIR TRAVEL is both the most advanced form of <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">transportation</span> and the most boring,\u201d David Flexer, president of Inflight Motion Pictures, told the  New <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Yorker</span> \u00a0in 1962. Mr Flexer had just spent years developing the technology to bring in-flight movies to Trans World Airlines, which in 1961\u00a0became\u00a0the first <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">carrier</span> to offer regular on-board films. This wasn\u2019t exactly the <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">debut</span> of sky-high <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">flick</span>s\u2014that came 40 years earlier, when Aeromarine Airlines showed \u201c<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Howdy</span> Chicago!\u201d to 11 passengers on a <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">leisurely</span> flight circling above the Windy City\u2014but it marked the start of an <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">explosion</span> of in-flight entertainment. Drop-down screens every few rows soon became common. Then seatback screens took over, allowing passengers to choose for themselves what to watch.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>But the expansion of in-flight entertainment was expensive. Individual screens cost as much as $10,000 per seat to install and require regular repairs, and their weight increases fuel costs. Airlines also have to spend millions of dollars a year on film licences. With ever more passengers bringing personal entertainment devices on board, some airlines began cutting back. In recent years, United Airlines, American Airlines and <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Hawaiian</span> Airlines all opted to go without seatback screens on some of their new planes. Bloomberg News <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">duly</span> reported in 2017 that \u201cYour in-flight movie screen is going <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">extinct</span>.\u201d It seemed that flyers without personal <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">gadget</span>s might once again find air travel as <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">anodyne</span> as Mr Flexer described.\u00a0\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>But the decline of in-flight entertainment may already be over. An arms race, it seems, has broken out among America\u2019s major airlines. And for once, it isn\u2019t over who can cut the most costs or <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">squeeze</span> the most fees out of flyers. It\u2019s over who can provide the best entertainment.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>United Airlines announced last month that it was going to start offering free live television, replacing a paid service, on 211 of its planes. On the same day American Airlines\u2014which already provides free live television on some of its flights\u2014trumped its rival by announcing that it would provide free access to Apple Music streaming for all passengers with personal devices. Two months earlier Southwest Airlines had started offering free movies for passengers to stream on their personal devices. <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Delta</span> Air Lines, meanwhile, is bingeing on seatback entertainment. Last year it had more planes with seatback screens than any other <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">carrier</span>. And Alaska Airlines has become the first American <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">carrier</span> to offer virtual-reality <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">headset</span>s on a trial <span class=\"word-wrap-span\">bas</span>is, following similar moves from European airlines.\n</p> <p>\n</p> <p>What\u2019s going on here? With fuel and labour costs beginning to rise, and passenger numbers likely to fall, airlines are starting to worry about how to stand out in an increasingly competitive business environment. \u201cWhen one guy starts competing on quality, another guy competes and soon everyone has it,\u201d Jan K. Brueckner, an economics professor at the University of California-<span class=\"word-wrap-span\">Irvine</span>, told the  Los Angeles Times . Flying these days may be trying in a number of ways, but at least it might be getting a little less boring.</p>", "Last": "2019_2_25_13.json", "Next": "2019_2_28_2.json", "assistent": {"Delta": {"ex": ["n. \u6210\u4eba\u82f1\u8bed\u6559\u5b66\u6587\u51ed\uff08\u5168\u5199\u4e3a Diploma in English Language Teaching to Adults\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u5251\u6865\u5927\u5b66\u4e3a\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u3001\u6559\u6388\u82f1\u8bed\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u8bed\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u9881\u53d1\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8bc1\u4e66\uff09", "\u7f51\u7edc \u53f0\u8fbe\uff1b\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32\uff1b\u8fbe\u7f8e\u822a\u7a7a"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['delt\u0259] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['delt\u0259] "}, "eg2": [["the Nile Delta", "\u5c3c\u7f57\u6cb3\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32"]]}, "Hawaiian": {"ex": ["adj. \u590f\u5a01\u5937\u7684\uff1b\u590f\u5a01\u5937\u4eba[\u8bed]\u7684", "n. \u590f\u5a01\u5937\u4eba[\u8bed]", "\u7f51\u7edc \u590f\u5a01\u5937\u8bed\uff1b\u590f\u5a01\u5937\u5f0f\uff1b\u590f\u5a01\u5937\u98ce\u5149"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[h\u0251:\u02c8waii\u0259n] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0[h\u0259\u02c8w\u0251j\u0259n] "}, "eg2": []}, "Howdy": {"ex": ["int. \u60a8\u597d"], "pron": {"peg": "['ha\u028adi]", "pam": "['ha\u028adi]"}, "st": {}, "wp": {"Howdy Corporation": "\u683c\u5229\u6208", "Richard Howdy": "\u6807\u7b7e", "LOVE HOWDY": "\u7231\u4e0a\u706b\u8776\u7684\u7406\u7531;\u7231\u4e0a\u53f0\u5317\u65b0\u5a18\u7684\u7406\u7531", "JOIN HOWDY": "\u52a0\u5165\u706b\u8776;\u52a0\u5165\u53f0\u5317\u65b0\u5a18", "Howdy y": "\u597d\u8482\u5931\u8e2a\u8bb0", "Howdy Skies": "\u51fa\u7248\u8005", "Howdy Relaxing": "\u970d\u8fea\u4f11\u95f2\u9152\u5e97", "JPN HOWDY": "\u6625\u5c71", "Boy Howdy": "\u8868\u6f14\u8005"}, "eg2": []}, "Irvine": {"ex": ["n. \u8b66\u5b98"], "pron": {"peg": "['\u0259:vin]", "pam": "['\u0259:vin]"}, "st": {}, "wp": {"Andrew Irvine": "\u5b89\u5fb7\u9c81\u00b7\u6b27\u6587", "UC Irvine": "\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u6b27\u6587\u5206\u6821;\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66\u5c14\u6e7e\u5206\u6821;\u5c14\u6e7e\u52a0\u5927;\u52a0\u5dde\u5927\u5b66", "eddie irvine": "\u57c3\u5c14\u6587;\u827e\u8fea\u00b7\u5384\u6587;\u827e\u5c14\u6587", "Irvine Marriott": "\u5c14\u6e7e\u4e07\u8c6a\u9152\u5e97;\u6b27\u6587\u4e07\u8c6a\u9152\u5e97", "Irvine Kinneas": "\u963f\u5a01\u6069;\u827e\u6587\u5c3c\u00b7\u5947\u5c3c\u4e9a\u65af;\u52a0\u85e4\u4e00\u90ce", "irvine museum": "\u6b27\u6587\u535a\u7269\u9986;\u5c14\u6e7e\u7f8e\u672f\u9986", "IRVINE College": "\u5b66\u5386", "Jerry Irvine": "\u6210\u5458\u6770\u91cc\u00b7\u6b27\u6587", "Lindsey Irvine": "\u8d5b\u00b7\u6b27\u6587"}, "eg2": []}, "Yorker": {"ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc \u7ea6\u514b\uff1b\u7f8e\u56fd\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u4eba\uff1b\u597d\u7403"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['j\u0254\u02d0k\u0259] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['j\u0254:k\u0259] "}, "eg2": []}, "anodyne": {"ex": ["adj. \u4e0d\u5f97\u7f6a\u4eba\u7684\uff1b\u6e29\u548c\u7684", "n. \u6b62\u75db\u836f[\u5242]", "\u7f51\u7edc \u6b62\u75db\u5242\uff1b\u9547\u75db\uff1b\u6b62\u75db\u7684"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['\u00e6n\u0259.da\u026an] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['\u00e6n\u0259.da\u026an] "}, "eg2": []}, "bass": {"ex": ["n. \u7537\u4f4e\u97f3\uff1b\u7537\u4f4e\u97f3\u6b4c\u624b\uff1b\u9c88\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u79cd\u98df\u7528\u6d77\u9c7c\u548c\u6de1\u6c34\u9c7c\uff09", "adj. \u4f4e\u97f3\u7684\uff1b\u4f4e\u58f0\u8c03\u7684", "\u7f51\u7edc \u8d1d\u65af\uff1b\u8d1d\u53f8\uff1b\u9c88\u9c7c"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[b\u00e6s] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0[b\u00e6s] "}, "eg2": []}, "carrier": {"pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['k\u00e6ri\u0259(r)] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['k\u00e6ri\u0259(r)] "}, "ex": ["n. \u8f7d\u6ce2\uff1b\u627f\u8fd0\u4eba\uff1b\u8f7d\u6d41\u5b50\uff1b\u586b\u6599", "\u7f51\u7edc \u5f00\u5229\uff1b\u8f7d\u4f53\uff1b\u822a\u7a7a\u6bcd\u8230"], "eg2": [["an armoured personnel carrier", "\u88c5\u7532\u8fd0\u5175\u8f66"], ["Aquarius, the Water Carrier", "\u5b9d\u74f6\u5ea7"], ["a baby carrier(= for carrying a baby on your back or in front of you)", "\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u524d\u80f8\u6216\u540e\u80cc\u7684\uff09\u5a74\u513f\u80cc\u5e26"], ["a telecoms carrier", "\u901a\u4fe1\u516c\u53f8"]]}, "debut": {"ex": ["n. \u521d\u6b21\u767b\u53f0\uff1b\u5f00\u5f20", "vi. \u521d\u6b21\u767b\u53f0", "n.
