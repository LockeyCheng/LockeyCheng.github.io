{"date": "2018-07-24 09:57:13", "content": "\n They shift risk from students to investors and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nudge</span> universities to think about employability\n \n ![Income-share agreements are a novel way to pay tuition fees](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180721_FNP007_1.jpg) \n \n TO PAY for his professional flight degree at <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Purdue</span> University in Indiana, Andrew Hoyler had two choices. He could rely on loans and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scholarship</span>s. Or he could cover some of the cost with an \u201cincome-share agreement\u201d (ISA), a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contract</span> with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Purdue</span> to pay it a percentage of his earnings for a fixed period after <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">graduation</span>.\n \n Salaries for new pilots are low. Mr Hoyler made $1,900 per month in his first year of work. Without the ISA, monthly loan payments would have been more than $1,300. Instead, for the next eight-and-a-half years he will pay 7.83% of his income. He thinks that, as his pay <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accelerate</span>s, he will end up paying $300-400 more each month than with a loan. But low early payments, and the certainty that they would stay low if his earnings did, made an ISA the better option, he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to pay what I could afford.\u201d\n \n Most American students take out low-interest, federally backed loans, the stock of which has grown steeply in recent years (see chart). Balances are usually written off after 20 years. That is the only insurance built into most students\u2019 debt. Though <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">repayment</span>s can be linked to future income, only 29% of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">borrower</span>s opt for this. And total loans are generally capped at $31,000. In 2016-17, 6% of under<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">topped</span> up with private loans, which have higher interest rates and no debt forgiveness.\n \n ISAs, by contrast, act as equity, not debt, with investors taking a share in a future income stream. Risk is shifted from students to investors, who can pool and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">diversify</span> it. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes who fail to land <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">steady</span> or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lucrative</span> work will pay less than the cost of their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tuition</span>. Caps on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">repayment</span> mean high-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flier</span>s do not end up paying back fortunes. ISAs also align the interests of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">borrower</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lender</span>, since investor returns are tied to a student\u2019s career progress. Investors will offer better terms to students at universities whose <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes earn well.\n \n ISAs have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mooted</span> before as a way to spare American <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes from mountains of debt. In 2014 bills were introduced in Congress that would have put them on a firm legal footing\u2014setting maximum loan terms, for example, and ruling that, like ordinary student debt, they would not be dischargeable by declaring <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bankruptcy</span>. One firm, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Upstart</span>, briefly marketed them directly to consumers. But the bills went nowhere and the idea <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fizzle</span>d.\n \n Similar <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proposal</span>s are once more being considered in Congress, but that is not the main reason why ISAs are attracting attention again. What has put them back on the agenda is the involvement of universities, which are starting to offer ISAs through their financial-aid offices, with outside investors providing some of the capital. Universities spy a way to lower their students\u2019 debt burden and spare them from having to take out private loans. Investors regard this as a sign that an institution is confident in its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes\u2019 earning power, which <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reassure</span>s them about the extra risk in an equity arrangement, compared with conventional student debt.\n \n <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Purdue</span> introduced ISAs in 2016. The first <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">participant</span>s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>ted last year, having used ISAs to cover fees of $12,000 on average. Funding came from its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">endowment</span>, which saw returns of 5-7%. Now it is raising capital from outside investors. Two other universities, Clarkson University in New York and Lackawanna College in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Pennsylvania</span>, have recently begun ISA schemes. One investor expects that another dozen will follow this autumn. The share of income signed over ranges from 2% to 17%, with students in high-earning fields, such as medicine or engineering, usually paying a smaller share of earnings for a shorter time than students of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">literature</span> or fine art.\n \n For investors, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">safest</span> bets are students on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vocational</span> courses\u2014nurses, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plumber</span>s, computer programmers and the like\u2014where post<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>te employment is the express aim and wages are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">predictable</span>. The difficulty with less <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vocational</span> subjects is in assessing whether a course will boost salaries <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sufficiently</span> for the deal to make sense. Most universities rely on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alumni</span> surveys to find out how much their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes earn, so data are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">patchy</span>.\n \n The stock of ISAs is tiny. Some 3,000-5,000 American students have used them to cover $40m in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tuition</span> costs, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">estimate</span>s Charles Trafton of FlowPoint Education Management, which creates and invests in ISAs. For comparison, in the 2016-17 academic year, private student loans totalled $11.6bn. Mr Trafton says he is buying ISAs for their combination of social impact and an investment return that he believes will match or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exceed</span> those for private loans, which are in the range of 4-15%.\n \n Only universities that are confident of their courses\u2019 value on the jobs market will be interested in partnering with investors, says Mr Trafton. \u201cThose that know their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tuition</span> is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overprice</span>d and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unconnected</span> to the economic value of their degrees will never have ISAs.\u201d He puts the latter <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cohort</span> at 70% of four-year universities.\n \n Universities that do take the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plunge</span> will be tracking their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes closely. That in turn will make pricing easier and help expand the market. Over time they will get fine-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">grain</span>ed data on their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gradua</span>tes\u2019 employment and salaries, says Tonio DeSorrento of Vemo Education, which operates ISAs for several institutions. Some may even adjust their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">educational</span> offerings to protect their investments.\n", "last": "2018_7_25_4.json", "next": "2018_7_25_6.json", "assistent": {"Pennsylvania": {"ex": ["n. \u5bbe\u5915\u6cd5\u5c3c\u4e9a\uff1b\u3010\u57ce\u3011\u5bbe\u5915\u6cd5\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde", "\u7f51\u7edc \u5bbe\u5dde\uff1b\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bbe\u5915\u6cd5\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\uff1b\u5bbe\u5915\u51e1\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[pens\u026al've\u026anj\u0259] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0[\u02ccpens\u0259l've\u026anj\u0259] "}, "eg2": []}, "Purdue": {"ex": ["n. \u666e\u675c\u5927\u5b66\uff08\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e00\u6240\u5927\u5b66\uff09"], "pron": {}, "st": {}, "wp": {"Purdue Boilermakers": "\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66;\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66\u9505\u7089\u5236\u9020\u5de5\u961f;\u5927\u5b66\u9505\u7089\u5de5\u961f;\u9505\u7089\u5de5\u4eba", "Purdue Calumet": "\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66\u76d6\u83b1\u9ed8\u6821\u533a;\u7f8e\u56fd\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66\u83b1\u9ed8;\u73b0\u897f\u5317\u6821\u533a", "Purdue Extension": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66\u519c\u4e1a\u63a8\u5e7f\u7cfb\u7edf", "Purdue Patricia": "\u540d\u79f0", "John Purdue": "\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u666e\u6e21;\u7ea6\u7ff0\u666e\u6e21", "Purdue Pharma": "\u666e\u6e21\u5236\u836f;\u666e\u5ea6\u5236\u836f;\u5236\u836f\u516c\u53f8;\u540e\u8f6c\u81f3\u666e\u6e21\u5236\u836f\u5382", "Purdue U": "\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66;\u666e\u5ea6\u5927\u5b66", "Purdue temple": "\u666e\u6e21\u6bbf", "Purdue Univerity": "\u666e\u6e21\u5927\u5b66"}, "eg2": []}, "Upstart": {"ex": ["n. \u66b4\u53d1\u6237\uff1b\u81ea\u547d\u4e0d\u51e1\u7684\u4eba\uff1b\u50b2\u6162\u81ea\u8d1f\u7684\u4eba", "adj. \u66b4\u5bcc\u7684\uff1b\u81ea\u547d\u4e0d\u51e1\u7684", "vt. \u4f7f\u2026\u7a81\u7136\u8df3\u8d77\uff1b\u4f7f\u2026\u5d1b\u8d77", "vi. \u7a81\u7136\u8df3\u8d77\uff1b\u5d1b\u8d77"], "pron": {"peg": "['\u028cpst\u0251rt]", "pam": "['\u028cpst\u0251rt]"}, "st": {}, "wp": {"STYLE UPSTART": "\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b0\u8d35", "back upstart": "\u540e\u4e0a", "URBAN UPSTART": "\u90fd\u5e02\u65b0\u8d35;\u90fd\u5e02\u65b0\u8d35\u5fc5\u5907", "quick upstart": "\u6025\u52bf\u8e6c\u8db3\u4e0a", "still upstart": "\u6162\u62c9\u4e0a", "drop upstart": "\u540e\u5012\u5c48\u4f38\u4e0a", "drip upstart": "\u540e\u5012\u5c48\u4f38\u4e0a", "floor upstart": "\u5c48\u4f38\u8d77", "SYNCON Upstart": "\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5a74\u513f\u5feb\u6536\u624b\u63a8\u8f66"}, "eg2": [["He tried to pass for a gentleman;but everyone knew he was an .", "\u4ed6\u8bbe\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u5df1\u5192\u5145\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u7ec5\u58eb\uff0c\u4f46\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u66b4\u53d1\u6237\u3002"], ["That\u2019s right.
