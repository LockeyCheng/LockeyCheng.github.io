{"content": "America is on track to admit the fewest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span> in four decades\n <span class=\"shortSum\">\n</span> Muslim <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span> are set to decline by 85%\n \n DURING the Iraq war, Suleiman\u2019s family worked closely with the American <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">army</span> in Mosul, as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interpreters</span>. When Islamic State took the city over\u2014and its fighters began driving around the city to search for them\u2014they fled east to Erbil, before IS came there, too. Suleiman (not his real name) is now in Amman, Jordan, waiting to hear about his long-stalled <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> case. Without a work permit, he is running out of cash. \u201cSomeone needs to tell me whether to go to jail, go to hell, or go to the United States, he says. \n For Iraqis seeking to flee to America as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span>, Suleiman\u2019s story is a typical one. In his first week in office, Donald Trump hastily signed a travel ban, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suspending</span> all <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> admissions for 120 days, which plunged travellers\u2019 plans into chaos and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">triggered</span> mass <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protests</span>. The travel ban has been withdrawn and resuscitated several times in response to legal challenges. Its third incarnation, which is still in effect, will be challenged before the Supreme Court next week. It has already had a drastic impact on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> admissions. \n In fiscal year 2018, the first one completely governed by the Trump administration, America is on track to resettle only 20, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">according</span> to The Economist\u2019s calculations\u2014a 61% reduction from the previous year, and the fewest since 1980, when the modern system of admissions was established (see chart) Those trying to flee from Syria, which America, along with Britain and France, recently bombed to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protest</span> against a chemical-weapons attack, are having an even tougher time. Whereas 6, were admitted in 2017, only 44 have been in 2018. Admissions from Iraq, Somalia and Iran have declined by similarly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">steep</span> margins. \n During his campaign, Mr Trump proposed a \u201ccomplete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d. He appears to be working steadily towards that goal. From 2013 to 2017, Muslims made up 41% of admitted <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span>. But more than halfway through the current fiscal year, they make up just 17%. Beleaguered religious minorities from Muslim countries, such as Iranian Bahais and Iraqi Yazidis, have also been harmed by the policy change, facing admission declines of 98%. Admissions of Christians, which were roughly equal to those of Muslims in previous years, have now surged to 58% of all incoming <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span>. \n The professed reason for the decline in admissions is to protect national security through, as Mr Trump terms it, \u201cextreme <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vetting\u201d</span>. The additional measures have been kept vague, to avoid giving \u201cour playbook to our enemies\u201d in the words of one official. Under Barack Obama\u2019s administration American screening was already among the toughest in the world, requiring interviews, continuous background checks, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fingerprinting</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">iris</span> scans. For some applicants, the process could take over two years to complete. Under Mr Trump\u2019s administration, the process has got more extreme still. \n These checks appear to be effective. A recent study by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank, found that the rate of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vetting</span> failure, when a person with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorist</span> sympathies is allowed into America and goes on to commit an attack, is vanishingly small: one in 29m. The study also found that the chance of an American dying at the hands of an improperly admitted <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorist</span> was one in 328m. \n Bureaucratic tweaks are also slowing the flow of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span>. To be admitted, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> applicant must be screened in person by agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) But the DHS has been reassigning agents who conduct these interviews and has also reduced foreign trips to carry out such screenings, leaving many applicants in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">limbo</span>. Medical and background checks expire after a set time, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prompting</span> some to restart the lengthy process. \u201cEven without the travel ban, there are many, many ways to throw sand into the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gears</span> to keep the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pipeline</span> from moving, says Bill Frelick, director of the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> programme at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group. \n Under American law, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> branch has nearly complete <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">authority</span> over <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span> policy. With minimal involvement from Congress, the president can set a cap on the annual number of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugees</span> admitted. Mr Trump, for example, has set this cap to 45, lowest ever\u2014though the actual number will be less than half that. So long as the White House does not articulate a policy of explicit exclusion, the chances of a successful court challenge are low. \u201cThey\u2019ve clearly found a legal way to enforce the Muslim ban, says Mark Hetfield, the president of HIAS, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refugee</span>-resettlement agency. \u201cThey\u2019ve realised that they can turn up the security <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vetting</span> and keep everyone out.", "next": "2018_4_26_1.json", "assistent": {"steep": {"eg2": [["a steep hill/slope/bank",
