purchases\n", "next": "2018_4_25_3.json", "content": "The Supreme Court seems divided over sales tax on online purchases\n Should online retailers have to collect sales taxes in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">states</span> where they have no physical presence? \n BILLIONS of dollars and long-standing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interstate</span> e-commerce rules are at <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stake</span> in a case that came before the justices on April 17th. The case revisits an old Supreme Court rule that retailers shipping goods to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">states</span> where they have no physical presence cannot be forced to collect sales tax from their customers. This standard is outdated, South Dakota\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">attorney</span>-general told the justices, and deprives <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">states</span> of \u201cmassive sales tax <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revenues</span> that we need for education, healthcare and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">infrastructure\u201d</span>. \n The conflict in South Dakota v Wayfair Inc arose in 2016 when the Midwestern state noticed that more of its residents were shopping online. In <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">defiance</span> of a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quarter</span>-century Supreme Court precedent, South Dakota tried to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shore</span> up its declining <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revenues</span> by imposing sales-tax collection on far-flung stores doing more than $100, of business, or conducting more than 200 transactions, in the state. \n When the conflict hit the lower <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">courts</span>, South Dakota\u2019s law was struck down as a violation of the constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause in line with Quill v North Dakota, a 1992 ruling. But the state pinned its hopes on Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s comment in 2015 that Quill was \u201cdoubtful\u201d and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ripe</span> for reconsideration. \u201c[D]ramatic technological and social changes\u201d in America\u2019s economy, he wrote, along with \u201cstartling\u201d state budget shortfalls, cast the Quill-mandated sales-tax regime in a less <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">appealing</span> light. \n It would take five justices to overrule Quill and permit <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">states</span> to force out-of retailers to step up and collect tax. Going into the hearing, conservative Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Kennedy all seemed <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inclined</span> to do that. The oral argument added a surprise fourth justice to that list: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">court\u2019s</span> fiercest liberal. In her questioning of George Isaacson, the lawyer for several online stores including Wayfair, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">homewares</span> company, she repeatedly called Quill <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">\u201cobsolete\u201d</span>. Requiring an \u201cout-of seller to collect tax on goods shipped in-state\u201d is \u201cequalising sellers\u201d, she said. \n In response, Mr Isaacson said the Commerce Clause seeks to ensure a \u201csingle national <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">marketplace</span> that is free and accessible to all <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">participants\u201d</span>. When the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">court</span> first weighed in on the question in 1967, America had 2300 different sales-tax jurisdictions. That number rose to 6000 by the time Quill was decided and stands at over 12, today. So any store selling <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wares</span> over the web would face the onerous task of calculating various items\u2019 precise tax rates for countless addresses across the country. Smaller retailers may not be up to the task. \n Exactly how burdensome and expensive the accounting might be is a matter of dispute. Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed to one brief claiming the cost would be as high as 250, a month for 30 transactions\u201d. Online software companies <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">filed</span> a friend-of brief <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">touting</span> services like TaxCloud and WooCommerce that might do the job for free\u2014but when Wayfair and the other retailers tested these websites, they quickly found them \u201crife with errors\u201d. \n These and other conflicting claims seemed to befuddle Justice Stephen Breyer, who may hold the key vote. \u201cWhen I read your briefs, I thought absolutely right\u201d, he told the lawyer for South Dakota. \u201cAnd then I read through the other briefs, and I thought, absolutely right. And you cannot both be absolutely right. \n The justices also pointed to disparate predictions of how much <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">states</span> stand to gain if the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">court</span> abandons Quill. South Dakota says it would reap another <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">50mintaxrevenuesthroughits2016lawandthatotherstateswouldseeincreasestotaling34bn</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">whereas</span> the companies cite Government Accountability Office estimates closer to $8-13bn. Whatever the figure, a lot of tax dollars, and a big consumer perk, are on the line when the Supreme Court hands down its decision in May or June. \n", "last": "2018_4_25_1.json"}
