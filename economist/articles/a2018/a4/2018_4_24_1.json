"2018-04-24 By Lockey.", "content": " China wages war on apps offering news and jokes\n For the Communist Party, this could be a risk\n AT THE end of last year Bytedance, one of China\u2019s most talked-about technology firms, seemed to have the world at its feet. Since its founding in 2012 more than 700m users had tried out its apps, which serve people with a diet of news, funny videos and memes, tailored to individual users\u2019 tastes by clever algorithms. The Beijing-based company had been valued at more than $20bn and embarked on a buying spree abroad in a bid to go global. \n The picture now is less rosy. On April 9th state media reported that Chinese regulators had suspended Bytedance\u2019s flagship app, Jinri Toutiao (Today\u2019 Headlines) for three weeks. They had also banned outright another of its products, a joke-sharing app <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">called</span> Neihan Duanzi, which specialised in bawdy humour and had more than 20m active users. Officials said its \u201cvulgar and banal\u201d content had upset people. Two days later Zhang Yiming, the firm\u2019s founder, issued an apology online saying he was \u201cfilled with guilt and remorse\u201d that his apps had taken \u201cthe wrong path\u201d. He said his company had not understood that \u201ctechnology must be led by socialist core values. He pledged that it would do more to spread \u201cpositive energy\u201d. \n Bytedance\u2019s travails, and those of three other firms that also had to suspend their news-aggregating apps, suggest that censors are trying to catch up with new technology. Officials appear to worry that people can immerse themselves in news and entertainment which, while <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">posing</span> no direct challenge to the party, fail to promote party views. Personalised news services <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> artificial intelligence have enabled users to wall themselves off from puff pieces about the party\u2019s latest achievements. (Jinri Toutiao\u2019s slogan, featured in the advertisement pictured above, promises readers \u201conly what you care about\u201d. David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says that \u201cparty leaders are aware of this. This is why Mr Zhang now promises to do a better job of promoting \u201cauthoritative media\u201d through his services. \n Censors are also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">paying</span> more attention to content they regard as \u201clowbrow\u201d: material deemed licentious, sexist or likely to encourage what the party regards as immoral behaviour. State media have reported disapprovingly on the uploading of videos to one of Bytedance\u2019s platforms by teenage mothers who do not appear contrite about having children before the legal age for marriage. Cultural commissars are becoming quicker to suppress anything they regard as non-mainstream, from hip-hop music to tattoos. The national football team recently took to the field with their ink hidden under bandages. \n In the past ten months officials have also been clamping down on gossip. Some portals have replaced their feeds offering news about celebrities with alternatives directing users to patriotic fare. Regulators have also shut down the microblog accounts of celebrity-gossip writers. The censors\u2019 reasoning may be that tattle about film stars might lead people to believe that it is also acceptable to peddle rumour about politicians. Or they may have simply decided that reading such news diverts people\u2019s attention from the latest utterances of President Xi Jinping. \n Xi\u2019s amazing\n \n Efforts to boost Mr Xi are reaching unprecedented heights. Pictures of him are commanding increasing amounts of space on the front pages of official newspapers. Last month a film <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">called</span> \u201cAmazing China\u201d became the country\u2019s highest-ever grossing documentary, in large part because government offices and state-linked companies have been encouraged to block-book screenings for their staff. The film dwells on the achievements of Mr Xi. In February the media regulator said that it would designate 5,000 cinemas as \u201cPeople\u2019s Theatres\u201d. These will have to devote more time to films such as \u201cAmazing China\u201d that promote socialist values. \n The censors\u2019 shifting priorities are a challenge for Chinese tech firms. Companies that operate social-media platforms or allow users to share content have their own in-house censors. In his online apology, Mr Zhang of Bytedance said he planned to expand his team of them by two-thirds, to 10,000 But such employees are often unsure how to interpret the government\u2019s directives. Last year the New York Times reported that regulators had circulated a less-than list of 68 types of material that internet firms were expected to expunge, ranging from media that promote \u201cunhealthy marital values\u201d to posts that blur lines between \u201cbeauty and ugliness\u201d. \n Satisfying the censors also involves financial risk. Bytedance and similar companies will find it much more difficult to attract and retain users without content that is \u201cborderline risqu\u00e9\u201d, says Bhavtosh Vajpayee of Bernstein, a research firm. Officials\u2019 distaste for news packaged by algorithm could impede China\u2019s development of artificial intelligence, since news aggregators such as Toutiao offer a profitable means of improving such technology. \n Above all, the party itself is taking a risk. In the decade or two before Mr Xi took over, people were given wider leeway to amuse themselves as they wished as long as they avoided politics. Officials may have reckoned that such an approach would reinforce stability by giving people less reason to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resent</span> the party. Mr Xi, by contrast, is trying to revive the party as an enforcer of morality and taste. By stamping on citizens\u2019 small pleasures he could irritate many people who had previously shown no interest in politics. \n The biggest fans of Bytedance\u2019s now-defunct humour app, for example, were men without great prospects living in smaller cities. That the app helped them form groups of like-minded individuals in the real world and engage in pranks such as honking their car horns in a coded sequence may help explain why the authorities shut it down. But by trying to insert more propaganda into such people\u2019s leisure time, officials could end up making the party seem like a bore who doesn\u2019t know when to shut up. \n In recent weeks, among the country\u2019s more than 700m internet users, there has been evidence of unhappiness with the party\u2019s meddling. On April 13th Sina Weibo, one of the country\u2019s biggest social-media platforms, declared a three-month effort to purge itself of posts containing pornography or promoting violence or homosexuality\u2014topics that had been ruled off-limits by the regulator. It is possible that Sina decided to mount its campaign in a highly public manner in order to show off its zeal to the party\u2019s media watchdogs. \n Angry people flooded the site with messages lambasting the firm\u2019s intolerance of homosexuality. Even the People\u2019s Daily, a party mouthpiece, weighed in against Sina. On April 16th the company said it would no longer target gay content that was not smutty. The incident marked a rare victory for online freedom and for gay rights. It was also a reminder of how contentious and how unpredictable China\u2019s expanding censorship has become.", "last": "2018_4_23_4.json"}
