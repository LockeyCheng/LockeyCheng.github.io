{"next": "", "content": "Technology and its discontents\n <span class=\"shortSum\">The role of technology is under attack\n</span> NUCLEAR bombs can destroy us. Facebook <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">undermines</span> our privacy. Artificial intelligence (AI) and robots can enslave us (or, worse, take our jobs) Synthetic biology and gene-editing have humans playing God. Social media make us depressed: we\u2019ve never been so connected yet never so alone. \n \n Those are just a few of the complaints levelled against technology. For most of human history, however, technology was mostly seen as a force for good. More people would live because of technical progress, from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refrigeration</span> to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vaccination</span>, than perish because of it, despite lethal inventions such as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gunpowder</span>. Technology was viewed as the fruit of open inquiry and debate, and its advance was broadly welcomed. More was better. \n Today a \u201ctechlash\u201d is under way. It comes in many forms, but two stand out. First, a belief that web <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">titans</span> such as Facebook, Amazon and Google have grown too dominant; and, second, a view that AI and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithms</span> are not transparent or accountable. Both concerns pit the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">individual</span> against potentially overwhelming power\u2014of the company, the platform, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span>. \n Take the web giants. They collect a vast amount of data on their users. Much of this is sensitive, from medical matters to political views. So protecting privacy is vital\u2014yet many people have been shocked at revelations about the extent of the information Facebook holds, and the company\u2019s relaxed approach to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">safeguarding</span> it. That has further fuelled fears about the platform\u2019s growing influence on society and politics. \n \n Facebook\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mantra</span>, \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d (an injunction to software developers not to rely on legacy code) has the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ring</span> of not caring about the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consequences</span>. The motto echoes the narrator\u2019s words in \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, written in a previous period of misgivings over the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accumulation</span> of power: \u201cThey were careless people, he <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">laments</span>. \u201cThey smashed up things . and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness. \n \n China\u2019s web giants, such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, face less of a \u201ctechlash\u201d. The Chinese state is hardly a champion of  privacy protection. Yet even there the extraordinary extent of data-gathering by the web companies is starting to raise <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">eyebrows</span>. \n The second concern\u2014over AI, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithms</span> and robotics\u2014involves a fear that the technologies may one day start to work beyond human control. Might such systems become so <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sophisticated</span> that they surpass the ability of people and institutions to manage them? And could that even threaten humanity? \n \n A more immediate threat is that the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algos</span> and bots may replace human labour, creating a jobs <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">apocalypse</span>. Economists are divided on this. Optimists point out that technology always displaces labour, but that new jobs are created around the new methods. Pessimists counter that never before have so many jobs been threatened at once. \n A further worry is that such technologies might operate outside the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transparency</span> and accountability that democracy requires. For example, in many court systems in America, bail, sentencing and parole are influenced by computer systems that inform the judge and other decision-makers about the likelihood that a person will miss their court date or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reoffend</span>. But the systems, supplied by private companies, are not open to outside <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inspection</span>, usually on security or intellectual-property grounds. In some cases, even the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">jurisdictions</span> that have licensed the software are unable to inspect it because of the commercial terms of use. \n To critics, this is the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">canary</span> in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">coalmine</span> for how the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithmic</span> society may unfold more broadly. If <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">safeguards</span> are lacking in the legal system, a domain inherently designed to have them, how can we be confident that adequate protection of rights will <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prevail</span> anywhere else? \n The struggle for liberalism in the 19th century involved the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">individual</span> versus the state. In the 20th century it added a new dimension: the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">individual</span> against the bureaucracy and the company. In the 21st century it has widened again: man versus <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span>. \n \n In Open Progress, the aim is to examine these issues in depth. It will also consider the controversies and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consequences</span> flowing from other emerging technologies, such as brain-computer <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interfaces</span> and self-driving cars. And it will look at the environment and potential responses to climate change. Technology seems destined to touch and transform just about everything: the case for understanding it within the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">framework</span> of liberal values is essential. \n",
