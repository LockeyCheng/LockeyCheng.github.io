Toyota now faces similar opprobrium for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">throttling</span> back the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">batteries</span> of some of its older Prius hybrid cars,, to prevent them <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">frying</span> their electronics. The software tweak\u2014performed during a voluntary recall of Priuses sold in America between 2010 and 2014\u2014forces the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicle</span> to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rely</span> more on its petrol engine and less on its electric motor/generators That causes fuel economy to fall and exhaust emissions to rise. Prius owners,, who bought their hybrid <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicles</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">precisely</span> because they <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">were</span> lean and clean,, have not been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">best</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pleased</span>. \n \n More <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">galling</span> still,, reports continue to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">come</span> in of overheating problems that leave Prius owners in limp-home mode or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stranded</span> in traffic unable to move. Online forums (see priuschat. have been abuzz with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tales</span> of woe from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">afflicted</span> drivers. Apparently,, owners of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicles</span> that are out of warranty have faced repair estimates of $3,500,500 or more. Toyota has since extended the warranty of the cars <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">affected,</span>, and promised to reimburse those who have been left out-of \n Even so,, the carmaker is now facing litigation over its recall remedy. A lawsuit brought by one of California\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">largest</span> Toyota dealers alleges that more than 100 of its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">customers</span> with Priuses that had already received the software update have returned with the same overheating problem. Toyota disputes the allegations and has sought to have the suit <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dismissed</span>. A judge has since ruled that the case can go forward,, and has set a date for the trial early next year. \n The source of the trouble is a box of tricks <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">under</span> the bonnet known as an inverter. This takes the 206-volt direct current (DC) from the Prius\u2019s nickel metal-hydride <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery</span> and converts it into the three-phase 500-volt <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alternating</span> current (AC) needed to drive the car\u2019s two electric motor/generators (One of these is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">used</span> to propel the car when operating <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">under</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery</span> power,, and to assist in recharging the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery</span> when braking; the other\u2019s main job is to keep the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery</span> charged,, while supplying supplementary <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">power</span> to the drive <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assembly,</span>, as well as serving as an electric starter for the petrol engine. Both motor/generators produce mechanical torque when driven by AC electricity\u2014or,, when spun backwards by an external source (ie, the hybrid\u2019s petrol engine or the wheels during braking), generate AC electricity. \n Managing this merry-go is the job of the inverter and its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">associated</span> electronic-control units. Inside the inverter is a hefty circuit board with a bank of heavy-duty switching <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">components</span> called insulated-gate bipolar transistors. These flip the direction of the DC supply from the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery</span> thousands of times a second,, to produce the three-phase AC needed for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">powering</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicle\u2019s</span> electric motors. Switching such a heavy current rapidly generates a serious amount of heat. To cope,, the inverter has its own glycol-based cooling system. \n This all works fine in normal conditions. Occasionally,, however,, a glitch in the inverter\u2019s software <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lets</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">matters</span> get out of hand. Microscopic voids then build up in the solder beneath the transistors,, causing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parts</span> to short-circuit or simply to overheat. Either way,, the temperature inside the inverter can rise rapidly. If that temperature <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">becomes</span> excessive,, the transistors get <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fried</span> and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicle</span> shuts down <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">completely</span>. More often,, the overheating <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">merely</span> causes the current to the inverter to be reduced,, the instrument panel to light up like a Christmas tree,, and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicle</span> to go into limp-home mode while things cool down. \n The quick fix <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">adopted</span> by Toyota has been to reset the inverter\u2019s software in order to reduce the likelihood of the transistors being <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stressed</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unduly</span>. That has meant lowering the current from the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery</span> and forcing the petrol engine to work harder to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compensate\u2014hence</span> the higher fuel consumption and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">increased</span> exhaust emissions. \n The experience has baffled many owners. Online queries have focused on why so <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complex</span> a contraption as an inverter/converter is needed anyway. Some have even <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wondered</span> why the Prius <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">uses</span> AC electric motor/generators when perfectly good DC motors and alternators have been around for ages? The presumption is that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> a DC motor would allow the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicle</span> to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">powered</span> directly from the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battery,</span>, obviating the need for an inverter. \n Well,, not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exactly</span>. Electric motors,, whether AC or DC,, work by causing a magnetic field in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rotating</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">part</span> (rotor) to interact with a magnetic field in the stationary <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">part</span> (stator) of the machine. Magnetic fields can be produced by permanent magnets or by electric currents <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">passing</span> through <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bundles</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wires</span> wrapped around an iron core. Whatever the mechanism,, all electric motors,, whether their input current is AC or DC,, require an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alternating</span> current in their stator windings to make their rotors spin. \n In a conventional DC motor this AC current is generated by carbon brushes that rub against a split copper <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ring</span> on the motor\u2019s spindle. As it <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rotates,</span>, this arrangement,, called a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">commutator,</span>, chops (ie, rapidly connects and disconnects) the direct current to create a crude form of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alternating</span> current. Unfortunately,, this causes numerous problems. Friction and electrical <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">arcing</span> at the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">commutator</span> means the brushes must be replaced <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">regularly</span>. Arcing at the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">commutator</span> also limits the voltage that can be used,, and thus the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">power</span> produced. And because of the heavy current coursing through a DC motor\u2019s inner windings,, the rotor can get <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">extremely</span> hot and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">become</span> difficult to cool. Conventional DC motors,, moreover,, require gear boxes because,, while huge at start up,, the torque they produce falls off rapidly with rotational speed. Finally,, DC motors are not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">particularly</span> good at being run backwards,, in order to generate electricity for recharging purposes. At best,, they are good for golf carts and fork-lift trucks. Hence the \u201cbrushless\u201d DC motors,, with their transistorised switching in place of mechanical brushes and a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">commutator</span>. These have no brush-related friction or arcing,, and control of the current means torque can be controlled without the need for multiple gears. Like other hybrid <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicles,</span>, this is what the Prius uses,, though it calls them synchronous AC permanent magnet motors. For all intents and purposes,, brushless DC motors and synchronous AC motors are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">essentially</span> the same. Both use permanent magnets embedded in their rotors and both need inverters. \n That,, though,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">raises</span> an interesting question. Why not go the whole hog and use the output of the transistors to drive what is known as an AC induction motor? That is what Tesla <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">does</span>. An AC induction motor <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">does</span> not need permanent magnets,, and can thus do without the expensive rare-earth metals that are an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">essential</span> ingredient of modern,, high-performance magnets. The answer is that while induction motors are ideal for electric <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicles</span> built for speed (like Teslas), they are not all that efficient when <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">used</span> for pottering around town or cruising <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lazily</span> down the highway. As cars and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lorries</span> tend to spend 90% of their time <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> little more than 10% of their maximum power,, brushless DC motors are a better bet for typical hybrid <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vehicles</span> like the Prius."}
