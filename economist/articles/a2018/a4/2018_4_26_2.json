Just try typing \u201cWill machines\u2026\u201d into Google. An <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span> offers to complete the sentence with differing degrees of disquiet: \u201c\u2026take my job? \u201c\u2026take all jobs? \u201c\u2026replace humans? \u201c\u2026take over the world? \n Job-grabbing robots are no longer science fiction. In 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University used\u2014what else? machine-learning <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span> to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assess</span> how easily 702 different kinds of job in America could be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">automated</span>. They <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concluded</span> that fully 47% could be done by machines \u201cover the next decade or two\u201d. \n A new working paper by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, employs a similar approach, looking at other developed economies. Its technique differs from Mr Frey and Mr Osborne\u2019s study by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assessing</span> the automatability of each task within a given job, based on a survey of skills in 2015. Overall, the study finds that 14% of jobs across 32 countries are highly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vulnerable</span>, defined as having at least a 70% chance of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">automation</span>. A further 32% were slightly less <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">imperilled</span>, with a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">probability</span> between 50% and 70%. At current employment rates, that puts 210m jobs at risk across the 32 countries in the study. \n The pain will not be shared <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">evenly</span>. The study finds large <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">variation</span> across countries: jobs in Slovakia are twice as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vulnerable</span> as those in Norway. In general, workers in rich countries appear less at risk than those in middle-income <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span>. But wide gaps exist even between countries of similar wealth. \n Differences in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">organisational</span> structure and industry mix both play a role, but the former matters more. In South Korea, for example, 30% of jobs are in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">manufacturing</span>, compared with 22% in Canada.
