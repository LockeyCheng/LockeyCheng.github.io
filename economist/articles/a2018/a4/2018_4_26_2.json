Just try typing \u201cWill machines\u2026\u201d into Google. An <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span> offers to complete the sentence with differing degrees of disquiet: \u201c. my job? \u201c. all jobs? \u201c. humans? \u201c. over the world? \n \n Job-grabbing robots are no longer science fiction. In 2013 Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University used\u2014what else? machine-learning <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span> to assess how easily 702 different kinds of job in America could be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">automated</span>. They concluded that fully 47% could be done by machines \u201cover the next decade or two\u201d. \n A new working paper by the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, employs a similar approach, looking at other developed economies. Its technique differs from Mr Frey and Mr Osborne\u2019s study by assessing the automatability of each task within a given job, based on a survey of skills in 2015. Overall, the study finds that 14% of jobs across 32 countries are highly vulnerable, defined as having at least a 70% chance of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">automation</span>. A further 32% were slightly less imperilled, with a probability between 50% and 70%. At current employment rates, that puts 210m jobs at risk across the 32 countries in the study. \n \n The pain will not be shared evenly. The study finds large <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">variation</span> across countries: jobs in Slovakia are twice as vulnerable as those in Norway. In general, workers in rich countries appear less at risk than those in middle-income <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span>. But wide gaps exist even between countries of similar wealth. \n Differences in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">organisational</span> structure and industry mix both play a role, but the former matters more. In South Korea, for example, 30% of jobs are in manufacturing, compared with 22% in Canada. Nonetheless, on average, Korean jobs are harder to automate than Canadian <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span> are. This may be because Korean employers have found better ways to combine, in the same job, and without reducing productivity, both <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">routine</span> tasks and social and creative <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span>, which computers or robots cannot do. A gloomier explanation would be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">\u201csurvivor</span> bias\u201d: the jobs that remain in Korea appear harder to automate only because Korean firms have already handed most of the easily automatable jobs to machines. \n", "next": "2018_4_26_3.json", "title": "A study finds nearly half of jobs are vulnerable to automation\n", "last": "2018_4_26_1.json"}
