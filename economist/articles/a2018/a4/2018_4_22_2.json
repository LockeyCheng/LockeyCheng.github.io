It happened in the run-up to the Anglo-American attack on Saddam Hussein in 2003, when the core organisers of some of the largest street <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">demonstrations</span> seen in Britain included the Socialist Workers Party and the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) both small groups with a gift for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mobilising</span> huge crowds. Similar alliances came into play in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protests</span> over Israeli military action in Lebanon and Gaza, and over the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">perceived</span> willingness of Western governments to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">condone</span> or encourage Israel. \n But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reactions</span> to the ongoing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">misery</span> in Syria, and to Western <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">intervention</span> in that country, have been entirely different. Secular <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">leftists</span> in the West, who in general <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">oppose</span> any use of force by their governments, were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">instinctively</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">horrified</span> by the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assault</span> on Syria <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unleashed</span> on April 14th by America, Britain and France. Many Christian churches in the West <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">opposed</span> the strikes, partly under the influence of co-religionists in Syria who see President Bashar al-Assad as a protector and are in turn <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protective</span> of him. But the response of politically <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">engaged</span> Muslims in the West ranged from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">awkward</span> silence to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complaints</span> that Mr Assad had not been punished hard enough for his crimes against the Syrian people. \n While <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">secular</span> radicals <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">denounced</span> their governments\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">militarist</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">imperialist</span> sins, the MAB, a group said by a government report to have links to the global Muslim Brotherhood but which denies any link, deplored the action against Mr Assad only on grounds that it was too little, too late, and perhaps even so <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mild</span> as to be counter-productive. In a statement issued shortly after the Western missile strikes, it said:\n \n For seven years, the people of Syria have been subjected to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">brutality</span> of the Assad regime and its allies amid international <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inaction</span>. Nearly 400, Syrians have been killed since the start of the conflict, and the latest air strikes <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">merely</span> send a message to the Syrian regime that the murder of civilians with any other weapon besides chemical weapons, will be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tolerated</span>. While long <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overdue</span>, the British government\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">condemnation</span> is welcomed.

Chemical weapons had been used against <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">besieged</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">enclaves</span> both earlier this month and in February, the NGO spokesman said. \n Although not many Muslim voices have been raised in active support of Western policy decisions, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mere</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">absence</span> of any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">negative</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reaction</span> across much of European Islam has been striking.

Within hours of the Western air strikes, three Christian leaders in Syria described them as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">brutal</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aggression</span>\u201d and an unjustified <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assault</span> on a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sovereign</span> country\u201d and insisted that there was no convincing evidence of the government having used chemical weapons.

In a statement issued shortly after the Western missile strikes, it said:\n \n For seven years, the people of Syria have been subjected to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">brutality</span> of the Assad regime and its allies amid international <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inaction</span>. Nearly 400, Syrians have been killed since the start of the conflict, and the latest air strikes <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">merely</span> send a message to the Syrian regime that the murder of civilians with any other weapon besides chemical weapons, will be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tolerated</span>. While long <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overdue</span>, the British government\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">condemnation</span> is welcomed.

Chemical weapons had been used against <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">besieged</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">enclaves</span> both earlier this month and in February, the NGO spokesman said. \n Although not many Muslim voices have been raised in active support of Western policy decisions, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mere</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">absence</span> of any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">negative</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reaction</span> across much of European Islam has been striking. Rashad Ali, a fellow of the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said he <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">detected</span> a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tense</span> silence\u201d among British Muslim leaders who were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">instinctively</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wary</span> of Western military action anywhere in the Islamic world but did not want to say anything that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">condoned</span> Mr Assad. \n In the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">words</span> of H.

Within hours of the Western air strikes, three Christian leaders in Syria described them as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">brutal</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aggression</span>\u201d and an unjustified <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assault</span> on a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sovereign</span> country\u201d and insisted that there was no convincing evidence of the government having used chemical weapons.
