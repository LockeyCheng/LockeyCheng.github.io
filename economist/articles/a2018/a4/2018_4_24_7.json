That is what visitors to the Supreme Court are likely to see on April 25th, when the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">court</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">convenes</span> to hear Trump v Hawaii, the final case of the nine-month term. The justices will consider an uncommonly fraught matter of presidential power: whether the third version of Donald Trump\u2019s restrictions on travel from primarily Muslim countries is consistent with the law and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constitution</span>. \n The challengers argue that Mr Trump\u2019s latest travel ban is a direct descendant of his campaign-trail calls for a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering America \"until our country's <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">representatives</span> can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">figure</span> out what is going on\u201d. Singling out members of one <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">religion</span> for especially burdensome treatment based on a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hunch</span> that they may be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorists</span> violates the First Amendment\u2019s Establishment Clause, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Maryland held, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California said the policy exceeds the president\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">authority</span> under a congressional statute: the Immigration and Naturalisation Act. A willing suspension of disbelief is key to properly experiencing any piece of theatre, and\u2014if Mr Trump is to prevail\u2014the same could go for this week's hearing. Noel Francisco, the solicitor general, will ask the justices to forget everything they think about Mr Trump\u2019s motive for issuing three successive <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> orders barring travellers from countries that are overwhelmingly Muslim. The third version is certainly the most refined\u2014it adds Venezuela and North Korea, countries that have few or no Muslims, to the banned list. But to think that Mr Trump no longer intends the travel ban as a partial realisation of his long-promised Muslim ban is to take an exceedingly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">charitable</span> view of his motives and to ignore his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tweets</span> disparaging Muslims. \n Courts have no business reviewing a president\u2019s immigration decisions regarding people not \u201cphysically <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">present</span> in the United States\u201d, Mr Francisco argues in his final brief to the justices. The ban\u2019s challengers \u201coffer no valid reason to impugn\u201d the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> branch\u2019s \u201ccountry-specific findings\u201d or to veer away from the so-called \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet</span> officials who helped Mr Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">craft</span> the policy. \n \n But an amicus brief written by Robert Loeb and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">signed</span> by ten former <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> branch officials looks to the origins of the \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d, contending that it has never stopped a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">court</span> from examining \u201cevidence showing that government officials have acted with an improper purpose\u201d. Instead, the idea merely served as a pragmatic cover for presumed facts that were not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">entirely</span> certain: \u201cif a copy of a document with a corporate <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">seal</span> was filed, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">court</span> would presume it was an official corporate <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">seal</span> issued by an authorised party unless someone submitted evidence to the contrary\u201d. But in Trump v Hawaii, Mr Loeb writes, the president\u2019s defenders \u201cseek to inflate this modest presumption into a high barrier <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thwarting</span> meaningful judicial review\u201d. That refashioning of an old principle \u201cshould be squarely rejected\u201d, he writes.     \n \n If the justices accept Mr Trump\u2019s assertion that they should simply presume his exercise of presidential power to be lawful and responsible, the former government officials warn, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">courts</span> will grant chief <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executives</span> a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dangerously</span> wide berth. The justices may \u201cbegin from the premise that government agents have acted properly\u201d, but they do not and should not hesitate from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peering</span> \u201cbehind the presumption to the actual facts\u201d. Otherwise, a \u201cJim Crow law <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">designed</span> specifically to disenfranchise black voters\u201d would go unprobed as long as it didn\u2019t mention African Americans by name. Overweening deference to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> power, in short, is not the way of the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constitution</span>. \n It is telling that the briefs supporting Mr Trump\u2019s immigration decisions expend more energy imploring the justices to look away rather than to carefully examine the justifications and motives behind the travel restrictions. Yes, Mr Trump may have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retweeted</span> anti-Muslim <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">propaganda</span> videos from a British hate group in November 2017, but \u201cthe President\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retweets</span> do not address the meaning\u201d of the travel ban \u201cat all\u201d. Nor, apparently, does his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tweet</span> from June 5th that his \u201cJustice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version\u201d that became the second version. And there is no reason to consider an August 17th <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tweet</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">trumpeting</span> a long-discredited story about General John Pershing, in which Mr Trump suggested that stamping out \u201cRadical Islamic Terror\u201d would be a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cinch</span> if America would only kill Muslim <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorists</span> with bullets that had been dipped in pig\u2019s blood. \n In an attempt to counter the unfortunate record their client has produced, Mr Trump\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lawyers</span> include a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">footnote</span> pointing to several nice things the president has said about Muslims. In a May 2017 speech in Saudi Arabia, for example, he \u201cpraised Islam as \u2018one of the world\u2019s great faiths\u2019 and emphasised that the fight against <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorism</span> \u2018is not a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">battle</span> between different faiths, different sects, or different civilisations\u2019 \u201d. And, the brief observes, he repeated this sentiment in a Ramadan message later that month. \n White House statements and speeches to foreign governments, of course, are scripted, edited and filtered; Mr Trump\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tweets</span> emphatically are not. But even the Ramadan greeting referred to \u201cbarbaric <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorist</span> attacks\u201d in Britain and Egypt and the \u201cperverted ideology\u201d that fuelled them. While Mr Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">noted</span> that these <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">terrorist</span> incidents were \u201cdirectly contrary to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spirit</span> of Ramadan\u201d, the subtext was not difficult to discern. Mr Trump has conveyed the message that Muslims are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dangerous</span> and his travel restrictions are a tool to keep millions of them far from America. His <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lawyers</span> know that, the justices know that. The question is whether a majority of the justices will bury their heads in the sand and give their blessing to a policy with little\u2014other than religious bigotry\u2014to recommend it. They will rule by the end of June. \n", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s travel ban heads to the Supreme Court\n", "assistent": {"hunch": {"eg2": [["She leaned forward, hunching over the desk.",
