{"content": "Donald Trump\u2019s takeover of his party is near complete\n \u201cNEVER has a party <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abandoned,</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fled</span> its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">principles</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deeply</span> held beliefs so quickly as my party did in the face of the nativist juggernaut,\u201d,\u201d Jeff Flake,, a Republican senator from Arizona,, said in a speech in March. \u201cWe have become strangers to ourselves. There is a lot of truth in this. The speed with which the Republican Party\u2019s establishment accommodated itself to a candidate,, and then a president,, who spurned all manner of norms and broke many bounds of decency,, as well as policy commitments,, was <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">indeed</span> without any precedent. \n Paul Ryan,, the Speaker of the House,, went from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">refusing</span> to campaign with Donald Trump (aft a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">recording</span> of him boasting about sexual assault became public) to failing quickly to condemn him (when, as president,, he spoke of \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of confrontations between neo-Nazis and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protesters</span> in Charlottesville,, Virginia) It now appears that Mr Ryan cannot stomach his position\u2014or,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alternatively,</span>, that he thinks the voters will not provide the Republican House majority he would <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">need</span> to continue in it after this November\u2019s mid-term elections. On April 11th he announced that he will not seek re-election. Like Mr Flake himself,, and Bob Corker,, a senator who <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">memorably</span> compared Mr Trump\u2019s White House to an \u201cadult day-care centre\u201d,, not to mention 40 other House Republicans\u2014a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">record\u2014he</span> is leaving the field of battle. However,, Mr Flake\u2019s analysis is also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flawed</span>. Mr Trump did not for the most part infect Republicans with new beliefs from beyond their ken. He connected,, and continues to connect,, with what a significant part of its base feels and with what it wants. In so doing,, he turned the anti-elitism the party has long <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fostered</span> in its supporters against its own leadership. In breaking taboo after taboo he did what many in the base had long wanted to see done and to hear said. He is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> the \u201cpsychoplasmic\u201d monsters in David Cronenberg\u2019s horror film \u201cThe Brood\u201d: the party\u2019s id made flesh. \n It\u2019s good to be the king\n \n This <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">undoubted</span> and persistent connection,, coupled with a surprising amount of loyalty from elsewhere in the party,, makes the president pretty much unassailable. Mr Trump,, polls say,, enjoys the support of 85% of Republicans,, compared with 65% for Mr Ryan and 40% for Mitch McConnell,, the Senate majority leader. That <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">does</span> not mean he can get anything he wants. Congress has been tougher on Russia than he appears to have wished. His promise to repeal Obamacare has not been fulfilled. He has not (yet) <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pulled</span> out of the Iran deal. His approach to trade goes against a lot of party history,, but on gun control,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">something</span> he has seemed to favour in the past,, a tentative <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sally</span> was nipped in the bud. \n But it <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">does</span> mean that criticising him,, or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">acting</span> in a way that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">helps</span> his critics\u2014for example by seeking to illuminate the nature of his business dealings\u2014is now almost impossible for a Republican who wants to go on functioning as such. As Mr Corker put it,, Republican voters \u201cdon\u2019t care about issues\u201d. They just \u201cwant to know if you\u2019re with Trump. \n Elected officials whose reservations about Mr Trump are not so strong that they want to spend more time with their families keep quiet,, content just to vent when in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">trusted</span> company. Some have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rowed</span> back from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">previous</span> criticism. In 2016 Mitt Romney,, a former governor and presidential nominee,, denounced Mr Trump as a \u201cfraud\u201d. Earlier this year he called outbursts about African migrants the president was reported to have made \u201cinconsistent with America\u2019s history and antithetical to American values\u201d. Now,, seeking a Senate seat in Utah,, he has accepted Mr Trump\u2019s endorsement and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">salutes</span> his \u201cextraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs\u201d\u2014while <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">claiming</span> to be \u201cmore of a hawk on immigration than even the president. \n The takeover of the party\u2019s institutions is largely <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complete</span>. As is usual when a party\u2019s candidate wins the presidency,, the Republican National Committee (RNC) has become a subsidiary of the White House. In keeping with the tenor of its new ownership,, it now has a website,, LyinComey. dedicated to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">attacking</span> the former head of the FBI (see Lexington) Ronna McDaniel,, who became the RNC\u2019s chair last year,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">previously</span> chaired Mr Trump\u2019s campaign in Michigan; Michael Cohen,, his personal lawyer,, who is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">under</span> criminal investigation,, is one of the RNC\u2019s deputy national finance chairs. \n Primaries for the November elections will see hundreds of hopefuls competing to look as close to Mr Trump as possible. There will be no easy victories,, if any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">victories</span> at all,, for his critics. The ideological campaign groups that Republicans had to please during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency\u2014the Club for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Growth,</span>, Heritage Action,, the Senate Conservatives Fund\u2014might have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">able</span> to resist the trend. But they have decided,, for the time being,, that Mr Trump is the true <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> they wanted all along. \n He is not. What he offers politics is not a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> agenda. It is not an agenda,, or an ideology,, at all. It is a set of feelings\u2014about patriotism,, about who is a proper American and who is not,, about <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">foreigners,</span>, about <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">elites,</span>, about sovereignty and about power. This <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fits</span> what Larry Bartels,, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee,, has found out by trawling through survey data. People who identify as Republican are united by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cultural</span> issues rather than <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">narrowly</span> political <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span>. They tend to share respect for the flag and the English language,, and negative feelings towards Muslims,, immigrants,, atheists,, and gays and lesbians. \n United in this,, they are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">oddly</span> divided on issues that have often defined the right in America and elsewhere\u2014such as what the role of the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">state</span> should be. Andrea Volkens of the Berlin Social Science Centre and her co-authors compared the manifestos of the Republican Party with those of parties elsewhere and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concluded</span> that Republicans sit closer to France\u2019s National Front than to the Conservatives in Britain or Canada (see chart 1). This is not Ronald Reagan\u2019s Republican Party. But then,, as Reagan knew,, parties reinvent themselves. The Republicans have done so more than once since their party was founded in 1854 as an appendage to the anti-slavery movement. After the civil war it was in the ascendancy,, providing 11 of the 15 presidents from the death of Lincoln until the Depression. This was the party of the union,, northern cities,, industrialists and protestants,, run by classical liberals who believed in a nightwatchman <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">state,</span>, content to pick up a colony or two but leery of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">foreign</span> wars. It came crashing down along with Wall Street in 1929\u2014at a time when Democrats already had southern whites,, northern immigrants and Catholics in their camp. With the Depression and the New Deal scrambling politics,, the Democrats came into the ascendant. Republicans lost all but two of the nine presidential elections between Herbert Hoover\u2019s win in 1928 and Richard Nixon\u2019s in 1968; they held the House for just four of the 60 years between 1935 and 1995. \n The passage of civil-rights legislation in the 1960s and the nomination of Barry Goldwater for the presidency in 1964 brought about a new transformation. Goldwater promised a return to the party\u2019s small-government roots,, railing against the Great Society notion that every problem needed a government programme and thus setting the tone for Reagan. Civil rights\u2014also seen by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> as a small-government issue\u2014delivered lots of white southerners. \u201cAs much as I hate to admit it,, George Wallace can\u2019t be nominated. Ronald Reagan can. He\u2019s right on the issues,\u201d,\u201d ran an advert for Reagan in 1976,, winking at the governor of Alabama\u2019s past offer of \u201csegregation forever\u201d. \n The common clay of the New West\n \n When Reagan was elected four years later his party was <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">balanced</span> on three legs. Economic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservatives</span> wanted government to spend less and tax less; social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservatives,</span>, including many evangelical Christians,, wanted the government to ban more and permit less; and national-security hawks wanted the government to wield enormous power overseas. This coalition ran the gamut from the libertarian to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deeply</span> illiberal,, but its factions had enough in common for the top brass to keep things moving along. The economic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservatives</span> and national-security hawks,, all well <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">represented</span> among party activists,, elected officials and big donors,, were allowed to run things,, so long as they paid sufficient regard to the social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservatives</span>. Part of the deal was they would not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">actually</span> carry out their oft-stated aim to reduce government spending radically: more popular in theory than in practice. Tax cuts,, on the other hand,, were fine with all but the most dour deficit hawks\u2014the more the merrier. \n But within this <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">odd,</span>, successful alliance there was already a significant constituency that wanted just what Mr Trump would later offer. Pat Buchanan,, a speechwriter for Nixon,, ran in the 1992 and 1996 primaries on a platform of opposition to immigration,, free trade,, gay rights and multiculturalism. The second time round he won four <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">states</span> and about a third as many votes as the winner,, Bob Dole. \n In the early 2000s,, with America <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">attacked</span> by terrorists and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mounting</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">foreign</span> invasions,, many of these people <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rallied</span> to the president: internal dissent in the party turned to the matter of taxes\u2014the key issue,, early on,, for the activists known as the Tea Party. The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">culturally</span> populist position re-emerged in 2008,, when the party no longer needed to support a sitting president and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> became smitten with the vice-presidential candidate,, Sarah Palin,, an Alaskan governor who <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compensated</span> for not knowing things by making Republican voters feel feisty. \n This form of Republicanism <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">attracted</span> a number of former Democrats. John Sides of George Washington University says this migration of working-class whites to the Republicans \u201cmainly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">occurred</span> from 2009 to 2015. It was not a consequence of the 2016 campaign\u201d (see chart 2). Mr Bartels concurs: \u201cI find <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">remarkably</span> little change in partisanship between 2015,, when Trump was first emerging as a national political figure,, and late 2017,\u201d,\u201d he wrote recently. Many of Mr Trump\u2019s supporters <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">joined</span> the party before he did so himself. Mrs Palin was the harbinger in 2008. In 2012 it was Herman Cain,, a black fast-food restaurateur,, lobbyist and Tea Partier who had never held elected office and wished to cut the income-tax rate to 9%. He was leading the Republican field when he was accused of sexual harassment by several women\u2014something which,, in those innocent days,, was enough to sink a candidacy. \n Mr Cain was not the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">only</span> recipient of the base\u2019s wayward affections: it was clearly reluctant to settle down with Mr Romney. In the end it did. But his campaign showed that the party was changing. After Mr Ryan,, his vice-presidential candidate,, talked <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> a regular fiscal <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> about <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tackling</span> the deficit with cuts to social security and Medicare,, the campaign <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">whisked</span> him into a witness protection programme. Never again was he allowed to trouble <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">elderly</span> Republican voters who wanted to keep the government\u2019s hands off their Medicare. Spending cuts were not for the party faithful: they were for other,, less worthy people\u2014a position that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">helpfully</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">allied</span> prejudice to prudence. \n Vice-presidential candidates could then still be controlled by party machinery. Non-candidates could not be. Fox News,, which came to dominate cable news in the 2000s,, happily provided a platform for populist <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> politicians,, including Mr Buchanan,, Mrs Palin,, Mr Cain and many more,, as well as for popular,, partisan and peculiar hosts <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity. It both articulated and enforced a new and often <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">increasingly</span> extreme post-Tea Party orthodoxy to which party higher-ups had to pay <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">heed</span>. \n Mr Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign might,, in other circumstances,, have fallen foul of this\u2014not least because he was clear about wanting to keep spending on Medicare and social security. But Fox is an entertainment channel built on righteous indignation as well as a political operation,, and in Mr Trump it faced for the first time a politician whose star power outgunned it. The prime-time audience for Fox News is around 2. In its pomp \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d,, Mr Trump\u2019s reality show,, was sometimes watched by ten times that many. The disparity allowed Mr Trump to dictate terms <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> the star he is. When Megyn Kelly,, a Fox News anchor,, asked Mr Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mildly</span> prosecutorial questions while moderating a primary debate,, Mr Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threatened</span> to boycott the network. Ms Kelly was not removed,, but Fox came firmly on to team Trump. \n Don\u2019t be stupid,, be a smarty\n \n What happened between 2009 and 2015 to bring about the shift in non-college white voters Mr Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">profited</span> from? The great recession which followed the financial crisis of 2008 might suggest an economic cause; the presidency of Barack Obama suggests a racial one. Neither explanation is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wholly</span> satisfactory. \n The Obama presidency began with credit <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shrinking,</span>, factories closing and homes <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">being</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">repossessed</span>. But these conditions hit Democratic-voting minorities the hardest. Frustration at stagnant incomes could be to blame,, but Mr Reagan and both Bushes were elected while median wages were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">growing</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">only</span> slowly. It is hard to see why a continuation of the same conditions should result in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">victory</span> for Mr Trump. And data <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">released</span> after the election showed that blue-collar wages had in fact been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">growing</span> at their strongest pace in years. \n Among the Republican Party\u2019s opponents on the left,, it is widely held that Mr Obama\u2019s election drew out racial prejudices of the sort Republicans have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">used</span> since Nixon\u2019s \u201csouthern strategy\u201d. There is truth in this,, though also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> oversimplification. The most comprehensive recent survey of the influence of racial attitudes on voting,, \u201cUs Against Them\u201d by Donald Kinder of the University of Michigan and Cindy Kam of Vanderbilt,, finds that voters who espouse racial <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stereotypes</span> (\u201cblack people are lazy\u201d) are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">indeed</span> more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">likely</span> to be found in the Republican Party. But it finds that to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mainly</span> because more white people vote Republican. White Democrats are pretty much as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">likely</span> to hold such views as white Republicans are,, and most of them voted for Mr Obama. A majority of whites who voted for both parties in 2016 said that it was important for whites to work together to change <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">laws</span> that are unfair to whites. \n There was also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">something</span> broader going on. The rise of social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">media</span> allowed people to talk about politics in an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unmediated</span> way,, reading and saying things that would never have been seen on broadcast television or read in newspapers. Fox understood,, to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> extent,, how this new <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unfettered</span> and often fact-free discourse worked. Mr Trump knew it in his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bones</span>. He could,, and did,, speak the language of vulgar resentment <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> a pro. For many of his supporters,, the more this was disapproved of,, the more valid and admirable it seemed. \n Party of one\n \n How long can his dominance persist? The American right has an abiding characteristic that elsewhere is mostly found among left-wing revolutionaries: it <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">eats</span> its children. Before Mr Trump came along,, the cycle usually played out <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> this: a challenger would win a Republican primary by accusing his opponent of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">being</span> a Washington insider who had <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">betrayed</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conservative</span> cause. He would then head off to Washington to rail against business as usual for a few election cycles before <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">being</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">attacked</span> in his turn as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">representative</span> of the hated establishment. \n At the moment this dynamic appears to be working in Mr Trump\u2019s favour,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">silencing</span> opponents and rewarding loyalists. At <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> point,, though,, the cycle will turn. Today\u2019s saviours will be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tomorrow\u2019s</span> traitors. \n Political parties <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">centred</span> on a single personality fall apart after the leader goes. Silvio Berlusconi founded two parties in Italy,, Forza Italia and People of Freedom. Both proved fissiparous in his absence. But this is an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unlikely</span> fate for the post-Trump Republicans. It is hard for a party to collapse <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">completely</span> in a two-party system. It is also rare for one to become again what once it was. Because the party was becoming Trumpian long before Mr Trump took over,, it will no more go back to the 1980s in his absence than to the 1880s. Mr Trump will not bequeath a set of political ideas as Reagan did those he had <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inherited</span> from Goldwater and others. But the attitudes he has ridden to office will still outlive him. \n If Trumpism is to define the Republican Party for the next decade or more,, there are three ways it could develop. The most worrying would see the party choose another leader who,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">like</span> Mr Trump,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">does</span> not care for the separation of powers,, judicial independence or a free press,, but <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unlike</span> Mr Trump goes about undermining them <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">effectively</span>. A second possibility is that the party loses power and becomes the elected <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wing</span> of an anti-government movement,, its default setting when the Democrats hold power. \n There is a third possibility. Trumpian attitudes could lead to matching policies,, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aimed</span> at <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fashioning</span> a new New Deal,, as Geoffrey Kabaservice of the Niskanen Centre,, a think-tank, puts it. A national project America\u2019s right could support might <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ease</span> the rigidity of a movement <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> of which <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">borders</span> on anarchism in its hostility to government and much of which equates compromise with treachery. But if based on white resentment,, and thus intent on excluding <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">some</span> Americans from its promise,, it could entrench as many problems as it solved.", "date": "2018-04-23 By Lockey.", "assistent": {"abandon": {"pron": {"peg": "[\u0259'b\u00e6nd\u0259n]", "pam": "[\u0259'b\u00e6nd\u0259n]"}, "eg2": [["Only they will not<b> abandon</b> me, only they will not betray.", "\u53ea\u6709\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9057\u5f03\u6211\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u80cc\u53db\u3002"], ["Finding himself under fire from all quarters, he had no alternative but to<b> abandon</b> his scheme for the time being.", "\u5728\u8fd9\u56db\u9762\u695a\u6b4c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c \u4ed6\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c \u53ea\u597d\u6682\u65f6\u653e\u5f03\u4ed6\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002"], ["But why should they?
