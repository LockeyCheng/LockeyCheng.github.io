Where is the flattery leading? DONALD TRUMP sits down on April 23rd for dinner with his French <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">counterpart</span>, Emmanuel Macron, at the 18th-century <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mansion</span> at Mount Vernon once owned by George Washington. It is hard to imagine two Western leaders with more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contrasting</span> world views. The host, a brash former reality-television host, was elected on a promise to shut <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">borders</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spurn</span> multilateralism. The guest, an erudite philosophy <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">graduate</span>, won power by rejecting nationalism and praising Europe and the liberal world <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">order</span>. Yet, against the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">odds</span>, Mr Macron is the European leader who has done the most to strike up an improbably warm relationship with Mr Trump. Some call him the \u201cTrump whisperer\u201d. But what can Mr Macron really hope to gain from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">this</span> charm offensive? \n Mr Macron does not seek to align himself unconditionally with the American president, although France took <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">part</span> in, and indeed pushed for, recent air strikes with America and Britain against Syrian <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">chemical</span>-weapons <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stocks</span>. Nor is he after some sort of affectionate relationship, although he seems genuinely to have found a way to relate to Mr Trump, another one-time political outsider. Rather, the French president\u2019s ambition is, at best, to encourage the American leader to use his influence in a more benign way and, at least, to keep him from inflicting real damage. This is why the most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pressing</span> matter during the three-day state visit will be to persuade Mr Trump not to walk away from the Iran <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nuclear</span> agreement on May 12th, as he has threatened to do. Mr Macron will also seek to convince Mr Trump to remain engaged in Syria, both <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">militarily</span> and diplomatically. Other prickly matters under discussion will include <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">trans</span>-Atlantic trade and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tariffs</span>, Russia and climate change. The French seem unusually happy to let Mr Macron make a go of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">this</span> relationship. They tolerated the way he treated Mr Trump to a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">grand</span> visit to France last year, complete with a Bastille Day <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">military</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parade</span>, of the sort that would have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unthinkable</span> for, say, Britain\u2019s Theresa May. But at some point <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">there</span> will be domestic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pressure</span> on the French leader to show something in return for all <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">this</span> flattery. Mr Macron has on occasion exaggerated his influence over Mr Trump. But he also knows full well that their differences are great and, at times, insurmountable. The French leader has notably got nowhere in persuading Mr Trump to return to the Paris climate agreement. \u201cSometimes I manage to convince him, and sometimes I fail, Mr Macron said earlier <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">this</span> year. In reality, the best the French president may be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">able</span> to hope for is to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tame</span> Mr Trump\u2019s wilder <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">instincts</span>, and keep him at least listening to those inside the Western liberal-democratic club. \n A year after his surprise election, and with a robust majority in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span>, Mr Macron <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">still</span> has political capital to spend. His domestic economic policies may not be popular at home, where <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unions</span> are leading strikes and students holding sit-ins. But a majority of the French like the way he has changed the country\u2019s image abroad. Mr Macron\u2019s talk of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">grandeur</span> and prestige goes down well, and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospect</span> of France acting as America\u2019s preferred European <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interlocutor</span> makes up for reservations the French have about Mr Trump. For now, Mr Macron may look like the smartest European handler of the tricky American president. In the longer run, though, if he cannot secure tangible return for his efforts, he will run the risk of looking naive, or foolish, or both."}
