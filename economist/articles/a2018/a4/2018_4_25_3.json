This <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">columnist</span> has only a few weeks to go, before heading off to a new Economist beat. So it seems like a good idea to summarise some of the themes which have dominated this blog. \n To start, long-term <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">investing</span>. Here are a set of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">precepts</span> every investor should remember. \n You can\u2019t start too early. Albert Einstein may not have said that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compound</span> interest is the eighth wonder of the world but it is a good motto to remember. Buttonwood started a pension plan for his daughters when they were three years old. Let us assume a return of 4% a year. That means a sum doubles in 18 years, quadruples in 36 and rises eightfold in 54. Looked at another way, say you have a set sum in mind for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retirement</span>. If you start saving at 20, you need to contribute only half as much money a month, as if you start at 30. \n Risk and reward are related, but don\u2019t think the latter is guaranteed. In <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">financial</span> theory, academics like Harry Markowitz and William Sharpe developed <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sophisticated</span> explanations for the link between risk and return. This is where we get concepts such as the capital <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">asset</span> pricing model (CAPM) or beta, a security\u2019s riskiness relative to the market. But risk is measured in terms of short-term volatility. It is assumed, if you hold a risky <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">asset</span> long enough, you will eventually get rewarded. But this is not the case when you start from a high valuation\u2014think of Japan in 1989 or the Nasdaq in 2000. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is barely higher than it was at the end of 1999. A positive nominal return could have been earned from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dividends</span> but the real return this century from UK equities has been only 1. real return from bonds 3. Risk is not about volatility, it is about loss of capital. That is why investors should always have some money in cash or government bonds. \n Long-term returns are likely to be lower from here. Even if equities do not perform as badly as in Japan since 1989, they are still likely to earn lower nominal returns from here. That is just maths. Short-term <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span> and long-term bond yields are low in both nominal and real terms. The return from equities is a \u201crisk premium\u201d on top of those <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rates</span>. There is no <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plausible</span> reason why the risk premium should be a lot higher today. The London Business School team of Dimson, Marsh and Staunton think it is currently 3. Based on a return to mean valuations, GMO forecasts negative real returns for all equity markets via the emerging <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ones</span> (the same goes for bonds) US pension funds that think they are going to earn 7-8% are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deluding</span> themselves. Charges are the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">financial</span> equivalent of tapeworm. Say you invest 100, (see this SEC <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">illustration)</span>. Of course, it is tempting to believe that the higher-charging product will <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deliver</span> a higher return. But you don\u2019t know that; the one thing you know for certain are the charges. A recent FCA study showed that, net of fees, \u201cmore expensive funds have produced worse returns for the investor. Nor can you rely on funds that have done well in the past to do well in the future. \n Diversify globally. A lot of statistics about long-term performance are derived from America, which was the great economic success story of the 20th century. But this is an example of survivorship bias; back in 1900, people might have thought that Russia, or Argentina, would do as well or better. It is tempting for Americans to think that they don\u2019t need to invest abroad; most of the tech giants are based in the US. But the Japanese might have seen no need to invest outside their home market in the late 1980s, after its phenomenal post-war performance. The US market is more than half the MSCI World Index. It will not last. Diversifying protects the investor against currency risk and political mistakes. Economic power is shifting towards Asia (where it resided before 1500) and where more than half the global population <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lives</span>. \n But don\u2019t specialise too much. The fashion today is to create thousands of different funds, covering ever smaller slices of the market. There has even been an ETF <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">investing</span> in ETF providers. Unless you are an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">investment</span> professional who has researched the area extensively, you don\u2019t need this nonsense. Beware also of new <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">investments</span> that simply claim to be uncorrelated. That could just mean they don\u2019t rise in value when everything else does. The return from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">investing</span> in equities is a share of profits; from bonds the risk-free rate plus credit risk. It is not at all clear what the return from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">investing</span> in volatility should be (let alone cryptocurrencies). There may well be no expected return from them at all. So why buy them?", "assistent": {"capm": {"pron": {"peg": 0, "pam": 0}, "eg2": [], "ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc \u8d44\u672c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b(Capital Asset Pricing Model)\uff1b\u8d44\u672c\u8d44\u4ea7\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7406\u8bba\uff1b\u8d44\u672c\u8d44\u4ea7\u8ba2\u4ef7\u6a21\u5f0f"]}, "staunton": {"pron": {"peg": 0, "pam": 0}, "eg2": [], "ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc \u65af\u6c64\u987f\uff1b\u526f\u4f7f\u65af\u5f53\u4e1c\uff1b\u65af\u5766\u987f"]}, "marsh": {"pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[m\u0251\u02d0(r)\u0283] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0[m\u0251r\u0283] "}, "eg2": [["Cows were grazing on the marshes.", "\u725b\u7fa4\u5728\u6e7f\u5730\u4e0a\u5403\u8349\u3002"]], "ex": ["n. \u6e7f\u5730\uff1b\u6cbc\u6cfd\u5730\uff1b\u6cbc\u6cfd\u6e7f\u5730\uff1b\u8349\u6cbc", "v. \u6e7f\u5730", "\u7f51\u7edc \u8fbe\u4fe1\uff1b\u9a6c\u4ec0\uff1b\u739b\u5e0c"]}, "investment": {"pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[\u026an'ves(t)m\u0259nt] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0[\u026an'vestm\u0259nt] "}, "eg2": [["to encourage foreign investment", "\u9f13\u52b1\u5916\u56fd\u6295\u8d44"], ["investment income", "\u6295\u8d44\u6536\u76ca"], ["This country needs investment in education.", "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u8d44\u3002"], ["a minimum investment of $10 000", "1 \u4e07\u5143\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u6295\u8d44\u989d"], ["a high return on my investments", "\u6211\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u9ad8\u6536\u76ca"], ["Our investments are not doing well.", "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u5883\u51b5\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002"], ["We bought the house as an investment(= to make money) .", "\u6211\u4eec\u4e70\u8fd9\u6240\u623f\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6295\u8d44\u3002"], ["A microwave is a good investment .", "\u5fae\u6ce2\u7089\u503c\u5f97\u4e70\u3002"], ["The project has demanded considerable investment of time and effort.", "\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u5df2\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u6295\u5165\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u591a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7cbe\u529b\u3002"]], "ex": ["n. \u6295\u8d44\uff1b\u6295\u8d44\u989d\uff1b\u6295\u8d44\u7269\uff1b\u503c\u5f97\u4e70\u7684\u4e1c\u897f", "\u7f51\u7edc \u6295\u5165\uff1b\u6295\u8d44\u5b66\uff1b\u6295\u8d44\u7406\u8d22"]}, "sery": {"pron": {"peg": 0, "pam": 0}, "eg2": [], "ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc \u585e\u91cc\uff1b\u8bb8\u6768\uff1b\u7530\u9038"]}, "ftse": {"pron": {"peg": 0, "pam": 0}, "eg2": [], "ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc \u5bcc\u65f6\uff1b\u5bcc\u65f6\u6307\u6570\uff1b\u82f1\u56fd\u5bcc\u65f6"]}, "retirement": {"pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[r\u026a'ta\u026a\u0259(r)m\u0259nt] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0[r\u026a'ta\u026arm\u0259nt] "}, "eg2": [["At 60, he was now approaching retirement.", "\u4ed6 60 \u5c81\u4e86\uff0c\u5c31\u8981\u9000\u4f11\u4e86\u3002"], ["Susan is going to take early retirement(= retire before the usual age) .", "\u82cf\u73ca\u8981\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u4f11\u3002"], ["retirement age", "\u9000\u4f11\u5e74\u9f84"], ["a retirement pension", "\u9000\u4f11\u91d1"], ["to provide for retirement", "\u4e3a\u9000\u4f11\u751f\u6d3b\u505a\u51c6\u5907"], ["We all wish you a long and happy retirement.", "\u6211\u4eec\u5927\u5bb6\u795d\u613f\u4f60\u7684\u9000\u4f11\u751f\u6d3b\u957f\u4e45\u800c\u5e78\u798f\u3002"], ["Up to a third of one's life is now being spent in retirement .", "\u73b0\u5728\u4eba\u4eec\u4e00\u751f\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u9000\u4f11\u751f\u6d3b\u3002"], ["He announced his retirement from football.", "\u4ed6\u5ba3\u5e03\u9000\u51fa\u8db3\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002"], ["She came out of retirement to win two gold medals at the championships.", "\u5979\u590d\u51fa\u540e\u5728\u9526\u6807\u8d5b\u4e0a\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u4e24\u679a\u91d1\u724c\u3002"]], "ex": ["n. \u9000\u4f11\uff1b\u9000\u4f11\u751f\u6d3b\uff1b\u9000\u804c\uff1b\u9000\u4f11\u5e74\u9f84", "\u7f51\u7edc \u9000\u5f79\uff1b\u9000\u4f11\u91d1\uff1b\u9000\u9690"]}, "msci": {"pron": {"peg": 0, "pam": 0}, "eg2": [], "ex": ["\u7f51\u7edc \u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u8d44\u672c\u56fd\u9645(Morgan Stanley Capital International)\uff1b\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u8d44\u672c\u56fd\u9645\u516c\u53f8\uff1b\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u8d44\u672c\u56fd\u9645\u6307\u6570"]}, "economist": {"wp": {"Economist Conferences": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u4eba\u4f1a\u8bae", "WESTBANK economist": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e08", "Economist Marshall": "\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6\u9a6c\u6b47\u5c14", "Regulatory Economist": "\u89c4\u5236\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6", "Economist blogs": "\u535a\u5ba2", "Building Economist": "\u5efa\u7b51\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6", "Construction Economist": "\u6784\u9020\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6", "assistant economist": "\u52a9\u7406\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5e08;\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7b56\u5212\u5e08", "agricultural economist": "\u519c\u4e1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5bb6;\u519c\u4e1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005"}, "pron": {"peg": "[\u026a'k\u0251n\u0259m\u026ast]", "pam": "[\u026a'k\u0251n\u0259m\u026ast]"}, "eg2": [["You know, Gordon, I should not like you.
