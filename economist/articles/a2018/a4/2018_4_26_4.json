much would you pay to keep <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> Google? \n <span class=\"shortSum\">Many internet services are free to consumers, but still valuable\n</span> <span class=\"shortSum\">\n</span> ONE of the great <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">riddles</span> about the American economy is why its growth has slowed down so much during the past few decades. Between 1946 and 1975, America\u2019s GDP per person grew at an average annual rate of 2. a year. On average, it has grown by just 1. a year since. \n Many economists believe that national accounts may underestimate the economic significance of technological innovations. Despite the advent of the internet, smartphones and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">artificial</span> intelligence, the official value added by the information industry as a share of GDP has scarcely changed since 2000. What might explain this paradox? \n Part of the problem is that GDP as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">measure</span> only takes into account goods and services that people pay money for. Internet firms like Google and Facebook do not charge consumers for access, which means that national-income statistics will underestimate how much consumers have benefitted from their rise. \n One way to quantify how much these internet services are worth is by asking people how much they would give up to forgo <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> them for a year. A new working paper by Erik Byrnjolfsson, Felix Eggers and Avinash Gannamanen, three economists, does exactly this and finds that the value for consumers of some internet services can be substantial. Survey <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">respondents</span> said that they would have to be paid $3, to give up internet maps for a year, and $8, to give up e-mail. Search engines appear to be especially valuable: consumers surveyed said that they would have to be paid $17, to forgo their use for a year. \n", "next": "2018_4_26_5.json"}
