ruling Law and Justice party is doing lasting damage\n \n <span class=\"shortSum\">Once hollowed out, the rule of law is hard to restore\n</span> <span class=\"shortSum\">\n</span> FOR a glimpse of Poland under the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tune</span> in to the news on the state television channel, Telewizja Polska (TVP) The opening <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sequence</span>, a computer-animated tour of Polish landmarks, homes in on the clock tower of Warsaw\u2019s royal castle. The capital\u2019s most recognisable building, the towering Soviet-era Palace of Culture and Science, is nowhere to be seen. Then the anchors appear, and proceed to praise PiS slavishly while <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">branding</span> its critics treacherous crypto-communists.\n \n This combination of subtle and brazen <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nationalist</span> revisionism captures the two-and years of PiS rule. The party has purged the public administration, made it illegal to accuse the \u201cPolish nation\u201d of complicity in the Holocaust, and peddled <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">conspiracy</span> theories about the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aeroplane</span> crash in 2010 which killed then-president Lech Kaczynski and 95 others outside Smolensk, in Russia. It has turned a blind eye to chauvinism among its supporters, while <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prosecuting</span> peaceful counter-protesters at the monthly commemorations of the Smolensk disaster led by Lech\u2019s twin brother, Jaroslaw (pictured) who is PiS\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">chairman</span>. \n Most troubling, PiS has neutered the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constitutional</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tribunal</span> and given <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lawmakers</span> and ministers more power over the appointment of judges, threatening their independence. It has sown deep divisions within Poland and with its allies in the European Union, as well as with Israel and America. It has transformed Poland from a poster-boy of post-communist transition into the EU\u2019s problem child. In March a judge in Ireland refused to extradite a Polish <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">defendant</span> to his homeland, worried that he might not get a fair trial. \n And PiS isn\u2019t done. Mr Kaczynski, who holds no office other than MP yet <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">acts</span> as Poland\u2019s de facto leader, recently told a right-wing weekly that there are \u201cparts of our reality which must not merely be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">modernised</span> but ploughed over\u201d. His party, he <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mused</span>, needs at least three terms in office. \n That <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospect</span> sends liberals scrambling for a stiff drink. It is a headache for the EU. In December the European Commission triggered proceedings against Poland under Article 7 of the EU treaty, which could ultimately lead to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suspending</span> its voting rights. In March, after the commission rejected Poland\u2019s justifications of its reforms, the government proposed softening them, for instance by limiting the justice minister\u2019s power to replace <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">district</span>-court presidents. But even if PiS <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">yields</span> further, the grief it has caused Poland will not go away. \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nationalist</span> international\n \n At first glance, the party\u2019s ascendancy follows a familiar script. From Viktor Orban in Hungary to Donald Trump in America, populists have converted economic malaise and fear of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">immigrants</span> into electoral success. Yet Poland departs from that script in important ways. Immigration is negligible; the wave of Syrian <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">migrants</span> in 2015, which initially crossed through Hungary, never touched Poland. Meanwhile, Poland\u2019s economic performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. \n The economy has grown for 26 consecutive years. GDP per person has nearly trebled since 1990 (see chart) Since 2000 manufacturing\u2019s share of the economy has grown, and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inequality</span> has fallen. Poland was the only EU country to weather the crisis of 2008-09 without a recession. \n For an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">illustration</span>, drive north from Warsaw into Mazowsze. The region is as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gorgeous</span> as a Chopin <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concerto</span>, an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">undulating</span> quilt of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cereal</span> fields and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">birch</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">groves</span>, but in the 1990s its towns were unromantically down-at Today it is dotted with handsome farmsteads. Tractors are still mostly Polish-made Ursuses, but now come with air-conditioning and sound systems. In the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cobbled</span> market square of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Pultusk</span>, a town of 20, and down the road in the village of Golymin, shops offer <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">luxuries</span> unimaginable two decades ago: 100Nikesneakersandwineat20 a bottle. \n Such wealth <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accumulation</span> was well under way by 2015. Yet PiS won both the presidential and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliamentary</span> elections that year. In <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Pultusk</span>, in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliamentary</span> election, the party claimed 46% of the vote, nine percentage points above its national average. In Golymin, it got 58%. \n Fatigue with the centre-right Civic Platform (PO) played a part. PO had grown complacent after eight years at the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">helm</span>. In 2014 its charismatic leader, Donald Tusk, stepped down as prime minister to become president of the European Council, leaving his party rudderless. Its politicians were caught on tape discussing matters of state in filthy language. They said nothing terribly damning, but it left a bad smell. \n Many voters were in any event growing fed up with finger-wagging <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">elites</span> telling them to work harder to get ahead. This dual weariness, with the PO and the post-1989 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gospel</span> of self-improvement, played into Mr Kaczynski\u2019s hands. He and his brother were among the leaders of the Solidarity movement who negotiated Poland\u2019s bloodless transition to democracy. But Jaroslaw, especially, felt that it let ex-communists off the hook too lightly. \n In 2001 the Solidarity coalition split into the PO, which <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">embodied</span> the post-1989 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consensus</span>, and the anti-elitist PiS. It <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">appealed</span> to those who, like the Kaczynskis, felt they deserved more, and who <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sensed</span> that, while they might be prospering, well-connected insiders were doing better. In 2005 PiS took a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quarter</span> of the vote, enough for a plurality in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span>. But its unruly coalition with two other anti-establishment parties collapsed two years later. \n By 2015 Poles\u2019 sense of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">being</span> shortchanged had grown, not because they were worse off, but because their aspirations outpaced reality. Many had experience of western Europe, where 2m or so had sought work since Poland joined the EU in 2004. Interviews with denizens of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Pultusk</span>-like towns by Maciej Gdula, a sociologist at Warsaw University, reveal that PiS supporters are neither left behind nor frustrated with their lives. But they want more\u2014and they want it now. \n PiS promised them less condescension and more protection. In Andrzej Duda it found a young, affable presidential contender who outmanoeuvred Bronislaw Komorowski, the PO\u2019s respectable but dull incumbent. Beata Szydlo, Mr Kaczynski\u2019s pick for prime minister, was less <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">divisive</span> than the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">chairman</span>, who kept a low profile. Aided by images of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">migrants</span> pouring into western Europe, PiS exploited fears of a Muslim <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">invasion</span>. The centre-left split into two camps, neither of which got enough votes to enter <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span>. PiS won an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unprecedented</span> absolute majority. \n With control of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span> and a sympathetic president, PiS prime ministers\u2014first Ms Szydlo and, since December, Mateusz Morawiecki\u2014set about delivering on campaign promises. They recklessly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reversed</span> a PO pension reform by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cutting</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retirement</span> age, introduced a monthly benefit of 500 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">zlotys</span> ($148) per child starting with the second-born, reformed the justice system (ostensibly to make it more efficient) and went after evasion of value-added tax, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">raising</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">receipts</span> by 23%. This flurry of activity made PiS\u2019s critics look like weak, privileged <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">naysayers</span>. Meanwhile, the economy continues to grow at 4%, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wages</span> are up and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflation</span> is subdued. \n PiS is aided by an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">underlying</span> conservative <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">streak</span> in Polish society. In the 1990s not even the left-wing governments championed social liberalism. Poland\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortion</span> law is among Europe\u2019s strictest. The global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment has been more #NotMe in Poland, outside a few feminist circles. Pride in Poland\u2019s undoubted virtues\u2014it never collaborated with the Nazis, and was the first country in the Soviet bloc to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">topple</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">communism\u2014can</span> turn xenophobic. At last November\u2019s independence-day march, some openly carried <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fascist</span> banners. \n Until 2015 pro-European <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">elites</span> maintained a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">guardrail</span> against such sentiments. PiS has dismantled it. \u201cNo Brussels <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureaucrat</span> will tell us what democracy is, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sums</span> up one person close to Mr Morawiecki. \n What is democracy, according to PiS? First, it is majoritarian. Any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constraint</span> amounts to \u201clegal impossibilism\u201d, Mr Kaczynski\u2019s term for what his liberal critics call checks and balances. The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">opposition</span> is given short shrift. Legislation is pushed through as private-members\u2019 bills, which unlike government proposals can dispense with public <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consultation</span>. In 2016 40% of PiS\u2019s 181 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">draft</span> laws were submitted in this way, up from 15% and 13% in the previous two <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliamentary</span> terms. \n Lacking a supermajority to amend the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constitution</span>, PiS did the next best <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thing</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nobbled</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constitutional</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tribunal</span>. It replaced five judges seated by the previous <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span> (includ two who, admittedly, the PO had appointed irregularly when a loss at the polls looked imminent) More egregiously, the government ignored several unfavourable rulings. \n The second feature of PiS-style democracy is rulers\u2019 freedom of action. The justice minister doubles as the chief <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prosecutor</span>, deciding which transgressions to prosecute (Smolensk counter-protesters) and which to ignore (marcher with illegal <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fascist</span> flags) A <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">draft</span> law would <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sack</span> the entire diplomatic corps and let the foreign minister rehire whomever he wants. \n In this worldview cadres are everything. According to an analysis by the Forum of Civic Development, a think-tank in Warsaw, 37 PiS laws have led to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sacking</span> of more than 11, civil servants. The party decides which ex-communists are repentant <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">patriots</span> (PiS\u2019 ranks are full of such figures) and which are unreformed enemies of the state. Many of the latter, including military top <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">brass</span>, have been purged. \n If this sounds like an affront to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constitution</span>, the PiS-dominated <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tribunal</span> seems <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unperturbed</span>. It judged 88 cases last year, half as many as in 2015, nearly always siding with the government. When the civil-rights <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ombudsman</span>, Adam Bodnar, challenged PiS\u2019s reforms of the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tribunal</span>, including the dodgy investiture of three judges, his complaint was rejected by a panel that included two of the judges in question. \n Does PiS, which won 38% of the vote in 2015, have a mandate to rip up the post-1989 social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contract</span>? Mr Morawiecki plays down Mr Kaczynski\u2019s talk of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revolution</span>. But, he adds, \u201cevery <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contract</span> can be amended. Polish institutions need a shake-up, he says. Courts average 685 days to enforce a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contract</span>, the fourth-slowest in Europe. None of the provisions in the judicial reforms, he says, is unique to Poland. \n Wolf in Italian wool\n \n It is a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cunning</span> sales pitch. No single move looks <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revolutionary</span> in isolation. Lithuanian supreme-court justices are appointed and dismissed by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span> at the president\u2019s request. In Denmark and Sweden ministers appoint members of the judicial council. As blatant as the state media\u2019s populist tilt is, PiS claims it is only correcting its historically liberal bias. \n Mr Morawiecki, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">millionaire</span> former banker, was promoted to prime minister in December at the orders of Mr Kaczynski, who had tired of Ms Szydlo. He is worldlier and cleverer than his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">predecessor</span>, and speaks fluent English. Where Ms Szydlo shunned Brussels, he engages. \n Yet when it <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">comes</span> to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ridding</span> the state of the (mostly imaginary) <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">remnants</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">communism</span>, Mr Morawiecki appears to be a true <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">believer</span>. In the 1980s his father founded a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">radical</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">splinter</span> of Solidarity. Mr Morawiecki, then a teenager, was kidnapped by the secret police, beaten and told to dig his own grave, but refused to give up his father\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">whereabouts</span>. In <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contrast</span> to many party colleagues, his disdain for the old regime seems genuine. But this zeal may lead him to push Poland closer to the sort of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d which Mr Orban has created in Hungary, and which Mr Kaczynski <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">makes</span> no secret of desiring. \n Poland is not quite Hungary. Its civil society is livelier. Its economy is more diverse and lacks media oligarchs, notes Jan-Werner M\u00fcller, a scholar of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">populism</span> at Princeton University. Viewership of TVP news is falling, while independent newspapers benefit from the PiS version of the \u201cTrump bump\u201d. Where other populists cosy up to Vladimir Putin, Mr Kaczynski loathes Russia, which he blames (with little evidence) for the Smolensk crash. \n PiS is not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">immune</span> to criticism. Proposals to regulate independent media have been shelved. So have efforts to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">outlaw</span> all <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abortions</span>, after thousands of women took to the streets. Courts have mostly dismissed the charges against anti-PiS <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">protesters</span>. Ms Szydlo\u2019s decision to award herself and her <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet</span> 2. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">zlotys</span> before her demotion may cost PiS in local elections in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">autumn</span>. \u201cBonus-gate\u201d may explain its slide in some recent polls. \n The party is not as monolithic as myth would have it, either. In March Mr Duda broke ranks and vetoed a bill which would allow <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">communist</span>-era soldiers to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stripped</span> of rank. A faction leery of Mr Morawiecki\u2019s rise has tried to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clip</span> his wings. Neither he nor Mr Kaczynski controls Zbigniew Ziobro, the Jacobin justice minister, who leads his own group in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span>. \n Then there is the EU. Besides the Article 7 proceedings, a growing chorus of member states wants future EU aid to be tied to rule-of considerations. Faced with a choice between <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revolution</span> and EU money, which flows disproportionately to its poorer rural base, PiS may think again. \n But even if PiS\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wrecking</span> job were halted, deep scars would remain. Society has split into <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">warring</span> camps. A PO leader looks bemused when asked if he has friends in PiS. Mr Morawiecki\u2019s aides react similarly to a question about pals in the PO. \n Purges of the military and intelligence services have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">strained</span> relationships with allies. Diplomatic fallout from the Holocaust law, which America and Israel see as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">whitewashing</span> the role some Poles played, has been disastrous. Poland risks becoming like Turkey, a prickly ally important only because of its strategic location, says a Washington insider. \n The economy, though healthy, could be better given the ruddy global outlook. Its rate of convergence with western Europe has slowed. A tight labour market and extravagant handouts have fuelled <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consumption</span> (the government has doled out 42. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">zlotys</span> in the new child benefit alone since 2016) but not private investment. Grzegorz Baczewski of Leviatan, a bosses\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">association</span>, blames this in part on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">regulatory</span> uncertainty. Laws affecting entire <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sectors</span> are rushed through <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">parliament</span>. A ban on Sunday trading was passed in January and came into force in March. Mr Morawiecki\u2019s talk of national champions and \u201cnational capital\u201d risks putting off foreigners. \n State <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">capitalism</span> of the sort the prime minister seems to favour may weigh on productivity. This needs to rise for growth to persist as the population, which dipped below 38m in 2015, continues to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shrink</span>. Few expect the child benefit to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reverse</span> the trend. In the short term it may <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constrain</span> the supply of labour. According to one estimate, the child benefit has discouraged 103, women from work. Labour-force participation among young women is at a 19-year low. The lower <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retirement</span> age will make matters worse. This, plus the expected fall in EU aid after 2020, prompted Fitch and Standard & Poor\u2019s, two <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rating</span> agencies, to revise Poland\u2019s potential GDP growth rate down to 1. in the next decade. \n Worst of all, PiS\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assault</span> on Poland\u2019s institutions <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">undermines</span> citizens\u2019 trust in them. Its campaign to paint the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">judiciary</span> as a corrupt clique\u2014complete with billboards depicting a drunk-driving judge\u2014doubtless contributed to falling confidence in the justice system, down from 41% in 2015 to 32%, according to a Eurobarometer poll. \n At best, PiS\u2019s illiberal reforms might be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reversed</span> by the next party that wins an election. But they have set a precedent: future governments may repeat the cycle of court-packing and purges. In the worst case, Poland may have started down the authoritarian road already travelled by Turkey and Hungary. Today few see this as likely. But when such things shift, they shift faster than anyone expects.", "title": "Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party is doing lasting damage\n"}
