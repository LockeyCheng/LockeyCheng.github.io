In 2015, the Lindo Wing charged \u00a35, ($8, for 24 hours in a deluxe room and a non-Caesarean <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">delivery</span>.  A survey in the same year by the International Federation of Health Plans found that the average fee for such a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">delivery</span> in the United States was $10, That rises to roughly $30, after accounting for care given before and after a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pregnancy</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">according</span> to Truven Health Analytics.
