His <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">seascapes</span> teem with light and energy and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suspended</span> motion. He often painted shipwrecks, boats at the mercy of storms, nearly Biblical scenes of floods, men and women and children <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flailing</span> in waves. He captured masterfully the sheer force, the awesomeness and the violence of the sea. \n Art has traditionally dealt with the sea\u2019s natural violence only. But a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compelling</span> body of newer work deals with questions of man\u2019s violence, to the sea and at sea. These works are welcome returns to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">maritime</span> art, and treat the sea as a political space rather than only a natural one. \n Eve Mosher, an American artist, made \u201cHighWaterLine\u201d to directly confront urban <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">blindness</span> to the sea. The project began in 2007 in New York, but has spread to several other cities since. Ms Mosher drew a line in blue chalk through Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan, ten feet (three metres) above sea level. Within the next century, scientists estimate that there could be flooding to that point as often as every four years. Large swaths of residential neighbourhoods were below her line, which she drew over the course of six months. Along the way, she was constantly explaining her mission to confused or intrigued or angry or inspired New Yorkers, who were forced to consider the possibility of the sea at their doorsteps. \n \n Five years later, Hurricane Sandy struck New York. Water flooded up to and sometimes past where Ms Mosher\u2019s line had been. \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to be a prophet(ess) she wrote on her blog. \u201cI never wanted it to happen. In later incarnations, \u201cHighWaterLine\u201d has been collaborative: in Bristol in 2014, hundreds of people helped draw a 32-mile line. \n A number of artists take a similarly literal approach to humans\u2019 relationship with the sea, by working with found objects\u2014found rubbish in particular. Done badly, trash-as feels <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">moralising</span>. But Mark Dion\u2019s work is successful because he pays a deep attention to display. This is especially true of the American artist\u2019s work modeled after Renaissance-era <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">\u201ccabinets</span> of curiosities\u201d. His 2014 piece \u201cCabinet of Marine Debris\u201d features plastic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">detritus</span> gathered during an expedition to islands off the coast of Alaska\u2014bottle-caps, old <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">moorings</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">detergent</span> bottles\u2014but carefully curated and arranged like collectors\u2019 objects, giving them a strange beauty. It\u2019s a challenge to the viewer: what are we looking at and why? Does this junk belong in a museum? Does it belong in the ocean? By asking us to consider the objects\u2019 context, Mr Dion also asks the viewer to consider where the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">debris</span> came from and why it was there in the first place. \n Then there is \u201cVertigo Sea\u201d, a video installation by John Akomfrah, a British artist who has made a breathtaking <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contemporary</span> portrait of the oceans. It is showing at \u201cSublime Seas\u201d, an exhibition which pairs it with Turner\u2019s \u201cThe Deluge\u201d (of the Biblical flood) at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Mr Akomfrah mixes archival film, BBC Natural History Unit footage, original filmed scenes and other video. Played across three screens, it feels like a constantly shifting collage. The sea is a rich source of life, a vast stage for human conflict throughout history, a mass <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">graveyard</span> and a space that is dying itself. The viewer is confronted with scenes of slaves in chains, packed together below deck; a polar bear shot to death; a whale sliced open for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">blubber</span>, bleeding; icecaps melting; seaborne atom-bomb tests. We also see luminescent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">jellyfish</span> floating to the surface, and surreal, still scenes that call to mind the paintings of Dal\u00ed and Magritte. We hear audio accounts of migrants\u2019 deaths in the Mediterranean, and of women pushed from planes during the Chilean junta. We also hear snatches of poetry. \n It is, in a sense, too much. Some scenes are hard to watch. But it\u2019s also mesmerising, a complicated and powerful history of man, beast, and the sea. Like Turner, Mr Akomfrah, Mr Dion and Ms Mosher demand that we pay attention to the sea. But they insist that we look at it in a new way. \n \u201cSublime Seas\u201d is showing at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art until September 16th 2018\n", "next": "2018_4_26_2.json", "title": "Artists are rediscovering the oceans that surround them\n", "date": "2018-04-25 By Lockey."}
