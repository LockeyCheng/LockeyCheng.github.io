{"title": "Donald Trump is more popular than ever with white evangelicals\n", "content": "Allegation of a dalliance with a porn star do not det the president\u2019 most faithful <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">supporter</span> even slightly\n \n IN CASE anyone should think American white evangelical are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">actual</span> in favour of extra-marital affair with porn stars, Robert Jeffress, a well-known pastor from Texas, offe a helpful explain last month. \u201cEvangelical still believe in the commandment, Thou shall not have sex with a porn star\u201d, he told Fox News. \u201cHowever, wheth thi president violat that commandment or not i total irrelevant to our support of him.\u201d\n \n It wa useful to have thi clear thi up. Since Stephanie Clifford, a porn star who i also known a Stormy Daniels, alleg that she had had a sexual tryst with Donald Trump on month aft hi third wife gave birth, the president appear to have become even more popular among white evangelical than he wa before. A survey by Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), publish thi week, suggest support among white evangelical for Mr Trump is, at 75%, at the high level ev recorded.\n \n That i much high than the president\u2019 42% approval <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rat</span> among the general population. It i also represent a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fair</span> steady recent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">increase</span> in white evangelicals\u2019 support for Mr Trump. Le than half back him <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dur</span> the Republican primaries, in 2016. But since Mr Trump became president their support ha not dropp below 65%. Robert Jones, chief executive of PRRI, said that fit a familiar establish pattern: evangelical tend to clust behind whoev emerg a the Republican candidate in a given race\u2014and clust even more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">forceful</span> when that candidate win office.\n \n But it seem remarkable that white evangelical could be so unfaz by Mr Trump\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lat</span> scandals. Last month, M Clifford fil a lawsuit against the president in an effort to be free of a hush agreement she had sign with hi attorney. Also last month, a form Playboy model call Karen McDougal gave a television interview in which she describ an alleg 10-month-long affair with Mr Trump in 2006 (which wa also the year of hi alleg tryst with M Clifford). M McDougal claim that the president had offe h money aft their first sexual encount and that she end the affair because she became consum with guilt about hi adultery. The White House ha den that Mr Trump had the alleg affairs.\n \n Perverse though it seems, it i no coincidence that the president\u2019 popularity with white evangelical ha increas amid these scandals. White evangelical are a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fad</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">force</span> in American politic and society and Mr Trump ha cast himself a their defender. So when he com und attack, they consid themselv to be und attack too.\n \n A PRRI survey conduct last year found the proportion of American who are white evangelical had fallen to 17%, from 23% in 2006. The interven year featur anoth development, the introduction of gay marriage, which for many conservative Christian i both emblematic of their decline and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exceptional</span> aggravating. Mr Trump ha signall hi sympathy for such cultural fear by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vow</span> to exclude transgend people from the arm forces. He ha also align himself firm with the pro-life movement, includ by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">address</span> an annual anti-abortion march in Washington and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">appoint</span> conservative judges. The aggressive mann in which he ha claim to be lead a counter-cultural pushback seem to go down with white evangelical especial well. \u201cTrump i like the boy who punch the bul in the playground\u201d, say Mr Jones. \u201cThey like that\u201d.\n \n A <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">longstand</span> idea that white evangelical are most concern about the moral charact of their lead has, in the process, gone out the window. In a recent interview with Politico Tony Perkins, the president of the Fami Research Council, an influential Christian campaign group, said Mr Trump\u2019 relationship with evangelical wa \u201ctransactional\u201d. He suggest evangelical had got much out of the deal, with Mr Trump <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deliver</span> more on policy, \u201cthan any oth president in my lifetime.\u201d\n \n Thi i a big reason why Mr Trump\u2019 approval rate have stay remarkab steady, despite the many scandal <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">buffet</span> hi administration. Evangelical are one of the bigg segment of hi coalition and they are go nowhere. The PRRI survey also found that 69% of white evangelical Protestant who identify with or lean toward the Republican Party would pref Donald Trump ov any oth candidate to be the party\u2019 presidential nominee in 2020.\n", "date": "Lockey 2018-04-24", "assistent": {"deliver": {"eg2": [["Then, from his workspace, he can<b> deliver</b> the changes to the stream.", "\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ed6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea4\u4ed8\u53d8\u66f4\u5230\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"], ["It is impossible to  this letter because the address is illegible.", "\u7531\u4e8e\u5730\u5740\u5b57\u8ff9\u4e0d\u6e05\uff0c\u81f4\u4f7f\u4fe1\u4ef6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6295\u9012\u3002"], ["No one will believe those promises because they know that later it will not be in your interest to .", "\u6ca1\u4eba\u4f1a\u76f8\u4fe1\u4f60\u7684\u90a3\u4e9b\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4eba\u4eec\u90fd\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u540e\u5c65\u884c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u627f\u8bfa\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7b26\u5408\u4f60\u7684\u5229\u76ca\u3002"]], "pron": {"pam": "[d\u026a'l\u026av\u025a]", "peg": "[d\u026a'l\u026av\u025a]"}, "ex": ["vt. \u4ea4\u4ed8\uff1b\u53d1\u8868\uff1b\u9012\u9001\uff1b\u91ca\u653e\uff1b\u7ed9\u4e88\uff08\u6253\u51fb\uff09\uff1b\u7ed9\u2026\u63a5\u751f", "vi. \u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u4f20\u9001\uff1b\u5c65\u884c\uff1b\u6295\u9012", "n. \u6295\u7403"], "st": {"similar": "rescue"}, "wp": {"Deliver Me": "\u62ef\u6551\u6211;\u5fcf\u9b42\u66f2;\u7ed9\u6211;\u89e3\u6551\u6211", "deliver babies": "\u751f\u5b69\u5b50", "Deliver gift": "\u53d1\u793c\u7269", "Deliver pamphlets": "\u6d3e\u4f20\u5355;\u6d3e\u5ba3\u4f20\u5355", "Deliver prevhlets": "\u6d3e\u4f20\u5355", "Must Deliver": "\u73a9\u547d\u5feb\u9012;\u73a9\u547d\u901f\u9012;\u5fc5\u987b\u9001\u4e0a\u95e8", "Deliver PUCCA": "\u4e2d\u56fd\u5a03\u5a03\u5356\u70b8\u9171\u9762;\u5e03\u5361\u9001\u9910\u5458", "deliver to": "\u8f6c\u4ea4;\u4ea4\u4ed8;\u4ea4\u4ed8\u8f6c\u4ea4\u4f20\u8fbe;\u6307\u793a", "solution deliver": "\u7269\u6d41\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546"}}, "forceful": {"eg2": [["The moment you catch yourself with an unwanted thought, interrupt the chain of thoughts with your  mental exclamation.", "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u4f60\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u601d\u60f3,\u7528\u4f60\u601d\u60f3\u4e0a\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u60ca\u53f9\u6253\u65ad\u601d\u7eea\u7684\u94fe\u6761."], ["\"I would like to see, frankly, a very<b> forceful</b> statement out of the Department of Justice as to what they intend to do, and what they think about it in some detail,\" said Specter.", "\u5766\u7387\u7684\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u770b\u5230\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u53d1\u8868\u4e00\u4efd\u975e\u5e38\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5177\u4f53\u5730\u8bf4\u660e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6253\u7b97\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002"], ["His calligraphy is vigorous and .", "\u4ed6\u7684\u4e66\u6cd5\u82cd\u52b2\u6709\u529b\u3002"]], "pron": {"pam": "['f\u0254rsfl]", "peg": "['f\u0254rsfl]"}, "ex": ["adj. \u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\uff1b\u6709\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\uff1b\u575a\u5f3a\u7684"], "st": {}, "wp": {"forceful impact": "\u529b\u7684\u51b2\u51fb", "forceful will": "\u610f\u5fd7\u529b", "Forceful Covenant": "\u5f3a\u63a8\u5723\u7ea6", "forceful stance": "\u5f3a\u786c\u7acb\u573a", "Forceful Strike": "\u5f3a\u529b\u91cd\u51fb;\u5f3a\u529b\u6253\u51fb", "forceful leader": "\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u9886\u8896", "forceful arc": "\u786c\u7535\u5f27;\u5f3a\u7535\u5f27", "forceful ramming": "\u5f3a\u592f", "forceful feature": "\u53ec\u5524\u7279\u6027"}}, "represents": {"eg2": [["Each line of this file  =.", " \u6b64\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u884c\u8868\u793a =\u3002"], ["But to her, it still<b> represents</b> his resting place.", "\u4f46\u662f\u4e8e\u5979\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5b83\u4ecd\u4ee3\u8868\u4ed6\u4f11\u606f\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002"], ["Each activity<b> represents</b> something that must be done by someone or something.", "\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5fc5\u987b\u7531\u67d0\u4eba\u6216\u67d0\u7269\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u67d0\u4e8b\u3002"]], "pron": {"pam": "[\u02ccr\u025bpr\u026a\u02c8z\u025bnts]", "peg": "[\u02ccr\u025bpr\u026a\u02c8z\u025bnts]"}, "ex": ["v. \u4ee3\u8868\uff08represent\u7684\u4e09\u5355\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\uff1b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u63cf\u7ed8"], "st": {}, "wp": {"fully represents": "\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0", "color represents": "\u989c\u8272\u8868\u793a", "Represents purity": "\u4ee3\u8868\u7eaf\u6d01", "represents something": "\u929d", "excellent represents": "\u4f18\u79c0\u4ee3\u8868", "represents an": "\u4ee3\u8868\u4e00\u79cd", "faithfully represents": "\u5982\u5b9e\u5448\u62a5", "model represents": "\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u8868", "mainly represents": "\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0"}}, "dur": {"eg2": [["Disadvantages: Less -able than latex or memory foam;
