{"date": "2018-06-06 08:21:36", "content": "\n ![A bright future for GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98681/40890924-4bad5ce0-6732-11e8-9648-192aa71f0830.png) \n\n I am very excited to announce that Microsoft is acquiring GitHub and expect the agreement to close by the end of the year. While it will still take a few months to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">finalize</span>, we wanted to share the news as soon as we were able.\n \n When GitHub first launched ten years ago, I could have never imagined this headline. Git was a powerful but <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">niche</span> tool, clouds were just things in the sky, and Microsoft was a very different company. Open source and business, people said at the time, mixed as well as oil and water.\n \n We disagreed. As developers, we knew this was a false <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dichotomy</span>\u2014we had been using open source software successfully in a business setting for a long time. What we really needed was an easier way to work with others regardless of whether the code was public, private, or something in-between. We wanted to do it using Git, we wanted anyone in the world to be able to join in, and we didn\u2019t want it to cost a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dime</span> if it was open source. So we created GitHub.\n \n Now, of course, things are different. Git is far and away the most popular version control system, clouds are mostly computers, and Microsoft is the most active <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">organization</span> on GitHub in the world. Their VS Code project alone is beloved by millions of developers, entirely open source, and built using GitHub\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Electron</span> platform. Beyond that, today major enterprises regularly embrace open source. The world has realized how important happy, productive developers really are. And also, people have smartphones now.\n \n What hasn\u2019t changed, however, is our focus on the developer. From the beginning, we have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">obsess</span>ed with building a product for the people using it. We want to make developers more productive and we want more people to become developers. From \u201cCode to Cloud and Code to Edge\u201d, GitHub\u2019s mission is to help every developer\u2014regardless of experience level\u2014learn, code, and ship software effectively.\n \n So as we look to the next decade of software development and beyond, we know it\u2019s all about the developer. And as we\u2019ve gotten to know the team at Microsoft over the past few years through <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">collabora</span>ting on projects from Git LFS to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Electron</span>, we\u2019ve learned that they agree. Their work on open source has inspired us, the success of the Minecraft and LinkedIn <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">acquisition</span>s has shown us they are serious about growing new businesses well, and the growth of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Azure</span> has <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proven</span> they are an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">innovative</span> development platform.\n \n But more than that, their vision for the future closely matches our own. We both believe GitHub needs to remain an open platform for all developers. No matter your language, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stack</span>, platform, cloud, or license, GitHub will continue to be your home\u2014the best place for software creation, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">collaboration</span>, and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discovery</span>.\n \n We both believe that software development needs to become easier, more accessible, more intelligent, and more open, so more people can become developers and existing developers can spend more time focusing on the unique problems they\u2019re trying to solve.\n \n We both see the growing need for developers and the growing importance of software in all <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">facet</span>s of our lives.\n \n And, most importantly, we both believe we can do greater things together than alone. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Collaboration</span>, after all, is at the heart of everything we do.\n \n As part of this change, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Nat</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Friedman</span> will be taking on the role of GitHub\u2019s CEO. We have been searching for a new CEO for some time and found in both Microsoft and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Nat</span> a partner we believe will strengthen and grow the GitHub community and company over the next few years. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Nat</span> has a ton of experience with software and the open source software community, having co-founded Xamarin and worked on numerous open source projects over the years, and is the perfect person to help GitHub grow and continue to make life better for developers.\n \n As for me, I\u2019ll be taking on a new role at Microsoft working closely with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Nat</span> and the team, and will share more details on that in the future.\n \n I\u2019m extremely proud of what GitHub and our community have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accomplish</span>ed over the past decade, and I can\u2019t wait to see what lies ahead. The future of software development is bright and I\u2019m <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thrill</span>ed to be joining forces with Microsoft to help make it a reality.\n \n @defunkt\n CEO &
