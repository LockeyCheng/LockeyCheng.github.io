Party, this could be a risk\n \n AT THE end of last year Bytedance, one of China\u2019s most talked-about technology firms, seemed to have the world at its feet. Since its founding in 2012 more than 700m users had tried out its apps, which serve people with a diet of news, funny videos and memes, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tailored</span> to individual users\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tastes</span> by clever <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithms</span>. The Beijing-based company had been valued at more than $20bn and embarked on a buying <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spree</span> abroad in a bid to go global. \n The picture now is less rosy. On April 9th state media reported that Chinese regulators had <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suspended</span> Bytedance\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flagship</span> app, Jinri Toutiao (Today\u2019s Headlines) for three weeks. They had also banned <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">outright</span> another of its products, a joke-sharing app called Neihan Duanzi, which <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">specialised</span> in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bawdy</span> humour and had more than 20m active users. Officials said its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vulgar</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">banal</span>\u201d content had upset people. Two days later Zhang Yiming, the firm\u2019s founder, issued an apology online saying he was filled with guilt and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">remorse</span>\u201d that his apps had taken the wrong path\u201d He said his company had not understood that technology must be led by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">socialist</span> core values. He <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pledged</span> that it would do more to spread positive energy\u201d \n Bytedance\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">travails</span>, and those of three other firms that also had to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suspend</span> their news-aggregating apps, suggest that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censors</span> are trying to catch up with new technology. Officials appear to worry that people can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">immerse</span> themselves in news and entertainment which, while posing no direct challenge to the party, fail to promote party views. Personalised news services <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">artificial</span> intelligence have enabled users to wall themselves off from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">puff</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pieces</span> about the party\u2019s latest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">achievements</span>. (Jinri Toutiao\u2019s slogan, featured in the advertisement pictured above, promises readers only what you care about\u201d David Bandurski of the China Media Project, a research group in Hong Kong, says that party leaders are aware of this. This is why Mr Zhang now promises to do a better job of promoting <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">authoritative</span> media\u201d through his services. \n Censors are also paying more attention to content they regard as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lowbrow\u201d</span>\u201d material <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deemed</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">licentious</span>, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sexist</span> or likely to encourage what the party regards as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">immoral</span> behaviour. State media have reported <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">disapprovingly</span> on the uploading of videos to one of Bytedance\u2019s platforms by teenage mothers who do not appear <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contrite</span> about having children before the legal age for marriage. Cultural <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">commissars</span> are becoming quicker to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">suppress</span> anything they regard as non-mainstream, from hip-hop music to tattoos. The national football team recently took to the field with their ink hidden under <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bandages</span>. \n In the past ten months officials have also been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clamping</span> down on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">gossip</span>. Some portals have replaced their feeds offering news about celebrities with alternatives <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">directing</span> users to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">patriotic</span> fare. Regulators have also shut down the microblog accounts of celebrity-gossip writers. The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censors\u2019</span> reasoning may be that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tattle</span> about film stars might lead people to believe that it is also acceptable to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peddle</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rumour</span> about politicians. Or they may have simply <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">decided</span> that reading such news <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">diverts</span> people\u2019s attention from the latest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">utterances</span> of President Xi Jinping. \n Xi\u2019s amazing\n \n Efforts to boost Mr Xi are reaching <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unprecedented</span> heights. Pictures of him are commanding increasing amounts of space on the front pages of official newspapers. Last month a film called Amazing China\u201d became the country\u2019s highest-ever grossing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">documentary</span>, in large part because government offices and state-linked companies have been encouraged to block-book screenings for their staff. The film <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dwells</span> on the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">achievements</span> of Mr Xi. In February the media regulator said that it would <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">designate</span> 5, cinemas as People\u2019s Theatres\u201d These will have to devote more time to films such as Amazing China\u201d that promote <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">socialist</span> values. \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censors\u2019</span> shifting <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">priorities</span> are a challenge for Chinese tech firms. Companies that operate social-media platforms or allow users to share content have their own in-house <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censors</span>. In his online apology, Mr Zhang of Bytedance said he planned to expand his team of them by two-thirds, to 10, But such employees are often unsure how to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">interpret</span> the government\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">directives</span>. Last year the New York Times reported that regulators had <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">circulated</span> a less-than list of 68 types of material that internet firms were expected to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">expunge</span>, ranging from media that promote unhealthy <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">marital</span> values\u201d to posts that blur <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lines</span> between beauty and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ugliness</span>\u201d \n Satisfying the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censors</span> also involves financial risk. Bytedance and similar companies will find it much more difficult to attract and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retain</span> users without content that is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">borderline</span> risqu\u00e9\u201d says Bhavtosh Vajpayee of Bernstein, a research firm. Officials\u2019 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">distaste</span> for news packaged by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">algorithm</span> could <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">impede</span> China\u2019s development of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">artificial</span> intelligence, since news <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aggregators</span> such as Toutiao offer a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">profitable</span> means of improving such technology. \n Above all, the party itself is taking a risk. In the decade or two before Mr Xi took over, people were given wider <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">leeway</span> to amuse themselves as they wished as long as they avoided politics. Officials may have reckoned that such an approach would <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reinforce</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stability</span> by giving people less reason to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resent</span> the party. Mr Xi, by contrast, is trying to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revive</span> the party as an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">enforcer</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">morality</span> and taste. By stamping on citizens\u2019 small pleasures he could <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">irritate</span> many people who had previously shown no interest in politics. \n The biggest fans of Bytedance\u2019s now-defunct humour app, for example, were men without great <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospects</span> living in smaller cities. That the app helped them form groups of like-minded individuals in the real world and engage in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pranks</span> such as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">honking</span> their car horns in a coded sequence may help explain why the authorities shut it down. But by trying to insert more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">propaganda</span> into such people\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">leisure</span> time, officials could end up making the party seem like a bore who doesn\u2019t know when to shut up. \n In recent weeks, among the country\u2019s more than 700m internet users, there has been evidence of unhappiness with the party\u2019s meddling. On April 13th Sina Weibo, one of the country\u2019s biggest social-media platforms, declared a three-month effort to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">purge</span> itself of posts containing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pornography</span> or promoting violence or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">homosexuality\u2014topics</span> that had been ruled off-limits by the regulator. It is possible that Sina <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">decided</span> to mount its campaign in a highly public manner in order to show off its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">zeal</span> to the party\u2019s media watchdogs. \n Angry people flooded the site with messages <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lambasting</span> the firm\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">intolerance</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">homosexuality</span>. Even the People\u2019s Daily, a party <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mouthpiece</span>, weighed in against Sina. On April 16th the company said it would no longer target gay content that was not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">smutty</span>. The incident marked a rare victory for online freedom and for gay rights. It was also a reminder of how <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">contentious</span> and how unpredictable China\u2019s expanding <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censorship</span> has become."}
