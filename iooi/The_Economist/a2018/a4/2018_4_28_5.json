The third in a series of farewell blogs\n IF YOU reach the age of 65 in the OECD, you can expect to l\n \u00a0or so (more if you are a woman, less if you are a man) If you stop work earlier than 65, and live a bit longer than average, you could easily be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retired</span> for 25-30 years, almost as long as you were in work. But people find it very hard to get interested in pensions (even Mrs Buttonwood) even though their financial future depends on them; retirement is too distant a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospect</span> and the issue seems too <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complicated</span>. This blog has written a lot on the subject so it is time to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">summon</span> some farewell thoughts. The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">executive</span> summary: pensions are more expensive to fund, employers are less willing to do so, so you will need to save more (a lot more) and/or retire later. \u00a0This may seem counter-intuitive; aren't we contributing money every month? State pensions are paid for by current taxpayers (ye, there is a US Social Security fund, but it is invested in Treasury bonds, which are a claim on taxpayers) Most state pensions run on a pay-as system; this year's benefits are paid for out of this year's tax revenues. When it comes to private sector pensions, many schemes have a fund, which is invested in bonds, equities, property etc. But what gives those equities, bonds and properties value in 2030, or 2050, when the pensions get paid? It will be the workers and taxpayers of 2030 and 2050 who will generate the income needed to pay the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dividends</span> on the equities, the interest on the bonds and the rent on the properties. As a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consequence</span> of this.  In other words, fewer young people are supporting more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retirees</span>. In 1950, there were 13. \n  for every 100 of working age (20-64). As of 2015, that figure had doubled, to 27. by 2050, it will have nearly doubled again, to 53. In some countries (Greece Italy, Japan, Portugal, South Korea and Spain) the ratio will be more than 70 by 2050. In part, this is down to lower <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fertility</span> rates (below the 2. needed to keep the population growing) and in part because of improved <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">longevity</span>. Since 1970, the life <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">expectancy</span> of the average OECD <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retiree</span> aged 65 has risen 4-5 years. At its heart, this is why state retirement ages have been trending <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">upwards</span>. On top of this.  A pension is an income and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">yield</span> on income-producing assets has fallen. In other words, the amount of income that can be generated by a given savings pot has declined. The way that savers can guarantee an income in retirement is to buy an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">annuity;</span> in Britain, the income from a \u00a3100, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">annuity</span> has dropped from \u00a315, in 1990 to \u00a35, today, a decline of two-thirds. That explains why <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">annuities</span> are unpopular, and why the British government stopped the requirement for people to buy them. But the alternative is to put your money in cash, where rates are even lower, or in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">riskier</span> assets like equities. The latter may generate a higher income but there is a risk of capital loss (imagine if you had <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retired</span> in 1929 in America, or 1989 in Japan) Companies that provide defined-benefits (DB) pensions face exactly the same risks as individuals. There is a market for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">offloading</span> a corporate pension liability; it is called the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">buyout</span> market and it involves the insurance sector. The cost of a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">buyout</span> has risen sharply as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">yields</span> have dropped. Accountants and regulators can see this and have required companies to account for the risk; that <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">implies</span> higher contributions. So private sector employers have retreated from DB pensions and offer defined-contribution (DC) pensions instead. These don't guarantee to pay anything; the worker gets a pot on retirement. The employee now carries the investment and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">longevity</span> risk.  That is pretty clear for public pensions. People may have to contribute for a set number of years. By and large those who earn more, pay more into the system <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">whereas</span> the pension is either a flat rate, or a benefit that pays a higher <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proportion</span> of final salary to the lower-paid. In the case of private sector DB pensions, it is the employer who usually makes the biggest contributions and is on the hook for any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shortfall</span>. Were workers to get their own contributions back (plus investment return) they would get a disappointing pension.  Employers may match contributions but even in a generous scheme, you would do well to get 15% of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">payroll</span>. The cost of a DB <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">equivalent</span> is 25-30% or more. The running costs of a DC <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sheme</span> are usually higher. So a DC employee cannot expect to get the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">equivalent</span> of DB benefits (two final salary after 40 years) Worse still, the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vagaries</span> of the market mean two people who contribute exactly the same cash amount over their lifetime could get wildly different pensions. So you need to save more (at least another 10% of salary) and/or prepare to retire later. This is not really <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complicated;</span> it is just maths. Alas, very few people get it. * There are some who would argue this point, on the grounds that pension contributions are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deferred</span> wages. While that is technically true, people don't act as if it were so. If it were, people who work for companies that offer DC pensions (where employers contribute much less than in DB) would get much higher pay than those in DB schemes. They don't. Note also that if the company goes <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bust</span>, guarantee schemes like the PBGC and PPF cap the amount of benefit, regardless of how much you contributed.", "date": "2018-04-28 By Lockey.", "title": "Hope I save before I get old\n", "last": "2018_4_28_4.json", "next": "2018_4_28_6.json", "assistent": {"portugal": {"ex": ["n. \u8461\u8404\u7259\uff1b\u3010\u56fd\u3011\u8461\u8404\u7259\uff1b\u8461\u8404\u7259\u5171\u548c\u56fd", "\u7f51\u7edc \u8461\u8404\u7259\u56fd\u5e86\u65e5\uff1b\u8461\u8404\u7259\u961f\uff1b\u91cc\u65af\u672c"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0"}, "eg2": []}, "consequence": {"ex": ["n. \u540e\u679c\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "\u7f51\u7edc \u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u63a8\u8bba\uff1b\u7ed3\u5c40"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['k\u0252ns\u026akw\u0259ns] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['k\u0251ns\u0259kw\u0259ns] "}, "eg2": [["This decision could have serious consequences for the industry.", "\u8fd9\u9879\u51b3\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\u3002"], ["Two hundred people lost their jobs as a direct consequence of the merger.", "\u5408\u5e76\u4e00\u4e8b\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8c\u767e\u4eba\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"], ["He drove too fast with tragic consequences.", "\u4ed6\u5f00\u8f66\u592a\u5feb\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u917f\u6210\u60e8\u5267\u3002"], ["to suffer/face/take the consequences of your actions", "\u81ea\u98df\u5176\u679c\uff1b\u9762\u5bf9\u2571\u627f\u62c5\u81ea\u5df1\u884c\u52a8\u7684\u540e\u679c"], ["Don't worry.
