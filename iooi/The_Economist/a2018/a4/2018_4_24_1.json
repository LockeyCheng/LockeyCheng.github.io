more than a car in Shanghai? \n Chinese cities find extreme ways of tackling <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">congestion\n</span> \n LIU LEI has been waiting to buy a car for more than seven years. Sadly, Mr Liu, an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">engineer</span> from Beijing, has had no luck in the capital\u2019s licence-plate <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span>. Introduced in 2011, this system for allocating number plates aims to tackle the city\u2019s problems of rage-inducing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">congestion</span> and asphyxiating pollution. Under the scheme, the city imposes annual <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quotas</span> on the issuing of new licence plates. Buying a car requires proof that one is in hand. Obtaining a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plate</span> involves entering a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bimonthly</span> draw. The odds of winning fell from 6% in February 2011 to an all-time low of 0. this February (see chart) In the latest one 2. people contended for 6, plates. \n In Shanghai, the financial capital, there are also strict <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quotas</span>. Unlike their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">counterparts</span> in Beijing, however, city officials put the plates up for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auction</span> online. At the most recent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">monthly</span> sale, around 217, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bidders</span> battled for 9, licence plates. The average winning bid was 88, yuan ($14 more than it costs to buy many <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">domestically</span> made cars. Last year Shanghai raised 12bn yuan in licence-plate sales, about 2% of its total revenue. \n Yet it is a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hybrid</span> model <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">used</span> in the southern city of Guangzhou that has become the favoured approach among <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">policymakers</span> in China\u2019s biggest cities. Under this system, some plates are distributed by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> and the rest sold at <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auction</span>. Since Guangzhou adopted this approach in 2012, three other large cities\u2014Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Tianjin\u2014have adopted it. \n None of the three methods is ideal. Start with Beijing\u2019s. Some people place a much higher value on owning a car than others. The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> system takes no account of that. This fuels a black market. Websites <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">abound</span> with illegal offers by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">winners</span> to rent out their plates. The average yearly fee for one is about 12, yuan. \n Beijing\u2019s system also breeds corruption. Song Jianguo, then head of the city\u2019s traffic-management <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bureau</span>, was jailed for life in 2015 for demanding <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">backhanders</span> in exchange for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rigging</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span>. A <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bribe</span> of at least 200, yuan was reportedly needed to guarantee victory. Mr Song pocketed a tidy 24m yuan before getting caught. Even today, 70% of Beijingers believe the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> involves <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dodgy</span> goings-on.\n \n Shanghai\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auctions</span> help avoid the creation of a black market. Yet they are unfair on the less well-off. Average winning bids have risen by a third in less than three years. Residents <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">moan</span> that owning a car has become the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">preserve</span> of the super-rich. The city says it <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reinvests</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proceeds</span> from its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auctions</span> in public transport. But in class-conscious Shanghai, owning a car is as much a status symbol as a means of transport. Obtaining a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plate</span> from elsewhere does not help much. Shanghai, like some other big cities, bans cars with non-local plates from <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">using</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inner</span>-city roads for much of the business day. \n Guangzhou thinks it has hit upon the right <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compromise</span>. By combining the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auction</span> systems it aims to make everyone happy. Those with deeper pockets can bid at <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auction</span>, and poorer <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">folk</span> still have a shot at winning the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span>. But a recent study by Jinhua Zhao and Shenhao Wang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that the benefit of such a system is less than meets the eye. \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">coexistence</span> of an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auction</span> reduces the number of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">participants</span>, but only slightly. Lottery entrants in Guangzhou still have a tiny chance of success; the winning odds were just 0. in the most recent <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lottery</span> draw in March. Meanwhile, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">auction</span> prices are not necessarily lower in cities with mixed systems. In December the average winning bid for a licence <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plate</span> in Shenzhen, for example, set a national record of 95, yuan. \n There is still hope for people like Mr Liu, however. To fight pollution, officials in nearly all big cities are allocating separate <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quotas</span> of licence plates for buyers of electric or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hybrid</span> cars. Such vehicles are also heavily <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">subsidised</span>. In fact, Mr Liu\u2019s wife has just applied for an electric-vehicle <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">plate</span>. These are offered on a first-come first-served basis. The odds are much better. Only four people are vying for each one."}
