fa-info-circle\">resignation</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rattles</span> Theresa May\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">delicate</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet\n</span> \n Replacing the home secretary will be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tricky</span>. And the Windrush scandal could yet claim more political scalps\n \n THE most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">delicate</span> balance in British politics is between those who backed Brexit and those who voted against it. So the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resignation</span> on April 29th of Amber Rudd, the home secretary and the most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prominent</span> Remainer in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet</span>, threatens to be highly destabilising for Theresa May\u2019s already-wobbly government. \n Ms Rudd quit after a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fortnight</span> of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revelations</span> about her department\u2019s treatment of the so-called Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants, who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971. The Home Office\u2019s recent policy of creating a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hostile</span> environment\u201d for illegal migrants has ended up ensnaring legal ones, including Windrush arrivals, many of whom lack the paperwork to prove their citizenship. Thousands are thought to have been denied access to housing, health care or work; some may even have been wrongly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deported</span>. \n The last <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">straw</span> for the home secretary seems to have been her statement to MPs last week that she knew nothing of official targets for immigration removals\u2014a claim that was quickly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">undermined</span> by leaked <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">correspondence</span> suggesting that in fact both she and the prime minister did. Those leaks may well have been payback from Home Office civil servants, whom Ms Rudd originally tried to blame for the scandal. \n Mrs May faces a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tricky</span> task in choosing a new home secretary. There will be pressure to pick someone from the Remain side of the Brexit debate to replace Ms Rudd, who has been among the most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">outspoken</span> in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet</span> on questions such as Britain\u2019s potential future membership of a customs union with the EU. The prime minister\u2019s weak position\u2014her Conservative Party lacks a majority in the House of Commons\u2014has limited her ability to manage her <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet</span>. Past rushuffles have been <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">botched</span>. \n The prime minister has another problem, too. Although Ms Rudd was in charge at the Home Office when the Windrush scandal <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">blew</span> up, the policy that created the problem was <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">invented</span> by the previous home secretary\u2014Mrs May. She was the one who pushed through the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hostile</span>-environment policy in 2014. Within minutes of Ms Rudd\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resignation</span>, Labour MPs were suggesting that she was carrying the can for the real <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">culprit</span>. The government will hope that the home secretary\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">departure</span> will bring the Windrush affair to a close. It could yet do just the opposite.", "title": "Amber Rudd\u2019s resignation rattles Theresa May\u2019s delicate cabinet\n", "last": "2018_5_1_5.json"}
