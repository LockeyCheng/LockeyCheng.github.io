But lately that view has come under attack, most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">notably</span> from President Donald Trump. Economists are asking themselves some tough questions. Is free trade always a good <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thing</span>? Do the losers from free trade need to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compensated</span>? To explore the basics of free trade, \n \n  spoke to John Van Reenen an economist at MIT. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity. \n : At its most basic level, what is free trade? \n : Free trade means allowing good and services to move as freely as possible across different countries. As countries developed, they started making and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">swapping</span> things among people within the borders of their own country. As transport improved, they could start buying and selling stuff abroad. For a long time there were big barriers to international trade. At a time when governments struggled to raise tax from their own people, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">levying</span> heavy import duties on things <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">coming</span> in from abroad was easier to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">implement</span>. But economists eventually won the argument, which said that keeping those barriers as low as possible was <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sensible</span> policy. \n : Is free trade good for economic growth? \n : As I see it, there are four big benefits. The first one can be traced all the way back to David Ricardo in the early 1800s. It allows countries to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">specialise</span> in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">producing</span> what they do best. For instance, the French are good at making wine, the British not so good. But the British are good at <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">producing</span> \n \n . Without trade, Britain would have to produce and consume its own its own wine. But with trade, Britain and France can focus on what they do best, with the French exchanging wine for more copies of \n \n . This is sometimes called <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">comparative</span> advantage\u201d \n As time has gone by, trade is increasingly not just about exchanges in final goods\u2014newspapers <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">versus</span> wine\u2014but <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">intermediate</span>\u201d goods. Think of a car. Thousands and thousands of parts go into making a car. Increasingly what has happened is that one part is made in France, another in Germany, another in Japan, and so on. Then they can all be combined in a fourth country like Britain. Even for a complex <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thing</span> like a car, nations can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">specialise</span> in what they are good at. \n The second benefit of trade is that it makes markets bigger. If you are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">producing</span> just for one country, your market is quite limited. But with trade, you can also start selling things to customers all over the world. That means that things like spending large amounts of money on research\u2014self-driving vehicles or whatever\u2014looks a lot more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">viable</span>. The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lump</span>-sum costs of such investment are spread out, so we can get more innovation, which is the key to growing national income. \n The third benefit relates to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">productivity</span> differences between firms. Some firms are really productive, others are really poorly managed. What happens when you have trade, is that you have much stronger competition. Domestic firms are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">competing</span> not just with other domestic firms but with firms all over the world. The less-efficient ones face more competition, so they shrink and they exit the market. Or they shape up. And the really <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">innovative</span> firms can expand. So it\u2019s about creative <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">destruction</span>, really\u2014shifting resources from less productive firms to more productive ones. \n The final benefit, which economists sometimes forget, relates to politics. With free trade, you come into more contact with foreign companies, new ideas, new people and so on. That\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mutually</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">beneficial</span>. And it is a political force for cooperation. Think of Europe. Since the second world war, those countries have had lower trade barriers, and that period has coincided with an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unprecedented</span> period of peace and cooperation. \n : What are the downsides of free trade? \n : There are well-known downsides. The way I like to think about it is that free trade increases the size of the pie. The overall amount of material wellbeing expands. But just because the size of the pie expands, it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone is better off. There are going to be some losers whose slice of the pie is so much smaller that they would have been better off with less trade. However, because the overall size of the pie has got bigger, the government can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compensate</span> the losers which can still make everyone better off. \n Let\u2019s think about how this might happen. In the 1980s China began opening up to the rest of the world. China was a low-wage country, so it started selling a lot of low-end <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">manufactured</span> goods like clothes. Although that\u2019s a great thing\u2014people can buy cheaper clothes\u2014workers in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">richer</span> countries who were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">producing</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">manufactured</span> goods now faced much <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tougher</span> competition. Workers in Bradford no longer just <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">competed</span> with those in Birmingham, but also those in Beijing. Those workers, especially less skilled ones in those industries, can be very seriously affected. \n I think economists <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">underestimated</span> the China shock. That may explain why policies to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compensate</span> the losers were insufficient\u2014especially in America where the social safety net, such as for health care, is so <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threadbare</span>. If there had been better policies, there would be much less of a political <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">backlash</span> against trade than we are seeing right now. \n : What can countries do to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">compensate</span> those people who do lose out? \n : There are lots of different options. The first <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">thing</span> I would <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">emphasise</span> is that you want to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">grease</span> the wheels of mobility\u2014to make it easier to move from one firm to another, or one industry to another, or one place to another. Putting up barriers to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">doing</span> that is costly. For instance, planning regulations sometimes make housing in dynamic parts of the country very expensive, which makes it difficult for people in struggling areas to move there. \n You also want to help citizens get the skills to move. So-called active labour market policies\u201d are important here. Scandinavian countries like Denmark do these quite well. Rather than protecting jobs by increasing the costs of downsizing which ends up making employers <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reluctant</span> to hire, these nations have generous unemployment-benefit systems combined with a lot of help for people who have become unemployed. Retraining is well resourced. Governments also <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">enforce</span> looking for work pretty strongly. \n It\u2019s also important to take a longer-term view. Your education system needs to make people <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resilient</span> to shocks. You want people to be well educated, and you want that education not to be too tightly linked to a particular skill. Having general skills\u2014literacy, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">numeracy</span>, social skills\u2014is the right idea. So, when people are hit by tough times, they can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reskill</span> and move around more easily. \n But it is also important to be realistic. Some people, especially older people, are not going to be able to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">retrain</span> if they were made unemployed by <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">structural</span> economic changes. For these people, there is nothing wrong with a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reasonably</span> generous welfare state and direct investment to support communities that are under stress from trade, technology or any other crisis. But remember: thanks to free trade, you can afford that, because the overall size of the pie is bigger.", "next": "2018_5_2_14.json"}
