28-year-old cook in Beijing. But he was not born in the capital so, under China\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">household</span>-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">registration</span> (hukou) rules, he is not treated as an official <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resident</span>, even though he and his wife work there and have a four-year-old daughter. One freezing night last November, he returned home to discover that the city government had declared many of their area\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tenement</span> blocks <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unfit</span> for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resident</span>ial use and had given the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inhabitant</span>s 24 hours to get out.\n \n \n The event quickly became <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">notorious</span>. The overnight <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"><span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">evic</span>t</span>ion of Beijing\u2019s \u201clow-end population\u201d (a term used in official planning documents issued by some of the city\u2019s districts) attracted worldwide <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">condemnation</span>. Queues of young families snaked away from the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">condemned</span> blocks, heading back to the towns and villages where they were born. But Mr Wang (a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pseudonym</span>) and his wife <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">balke</span>d at returning without jobs to a village where they had neither the experience nor the desire to farm. Instead they headed to another part of Beijing to start over again. He says his monthly rent is now far higher: \u201cI can\u2019t save anything. But at least I have a job and will stay as long as I can.\u201d If he leaves, he says, it will be because he wants to, not because the government has told him to go.\n \n \n Mr Wang belongs to a new generation of people from the countryside who have moved to work in cities. Over the past 40 years, hundreds of millions have done this, providing the blood, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sweat</span> and tears of China\u2019s economic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">miracle</span>. The Communist Party has often <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">congratulate</span>d itself that such a vast movement of people has happened without mass <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unrest</span>. But those such as Mr Wang who have left rural areas more recently challenge the party\u2019s sense of security. They face a wider range of problems than earlier <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">participant</span>s in the rural <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exodus</span>. They are dissatisfied with their lot and have little to lose. They may prove less <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quiescent</span> than their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">predecessor</span>s.\n \n When observers of China think of threats to the party, they often focus on the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rap</span>id growth of the country\u2019s new middle class. At some point, surely, China\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wealthier</span> millions will demand a more open, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accountable</span> and even <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">democratic</span> government, just as middle classes in other countries have done. But many Chinese analysts worry less about the kind of in<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stability</span> that occurred during the student-led protests of 1989. Rather, they <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fret</span> about <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">turmoil</span> created by members of a social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">underclass</span>: poor workers in the cities whose family ties are rural.\n \n After 1978, when Deng Xiaoping started to open up the economy, huge numbers of farmers began <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flock</span>ing to fill new labour-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">intensive</span> jobs, first in towns and later in cities. Their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cumulative</span> numbers reached 280m in 2017 (the rate of growth is now tailing off). In 2010 party documents began referring to a \u201cnew generation of migrants\u201d: those born since 1980. Some are offspring of earlier migrants and have lived in cities all their lives. Others have left the countryside in the past decade. This group has more than 90m members.\n \n The two generations are very different. Many of the early migrants were born at a time of mass <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">starvation</span> and were raised during the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">chaos</span> of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). Their determination to make good in the cities was intensified by childhood memories of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">poverty</span> and suffering. And if they did not succeed, at least they still had land in the countryside and experience of farming so they could return to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scratch</span> a living in the fields.\n \n Aiming high\n \n Members of the younger generation are children of Deng\u2019s reforms. They have never worked the land. A study published in 2009 in the Beijing-based Economic Research Journal said the younger migrants wanted \u201cpersonal development\u201d, unlike their parents who were focused on more basic needs. The new generation, it concluded rather <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">snobbishly</span>, \u201cis no longer willing to stay in the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dirtiest</span> jobs, is not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">frugal</span> enough to save money to send home and not able to earn enough to build a married life.\u201d Its members are less <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stoical</span> and unwilling to suffer in silence.\n \n Young migrants share four <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">characteristics</span> that worry the party. Like their parents, they are not well educated. The men face more of a \u201cmarriage <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeeze</span>\u201d than their fathers did, ie, a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shortage</span> of women of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">marriageable</span> age from similar backgrounds. They similarly earn low wages and face official <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discrimination</span> as a result of the hukou system that shuts many of them out of subsidised urban services such as education and health care. But they are more dissatisfied and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pessimistic</span> than their parents were. Their hopes of carving out a future in big cities are being <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wrecked</span> by high living costs, demog<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rap</span>hic change and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hostility</span> of local governments.\n \n In September 2017 a study in another Chinese journal, Sociological Studies, by Tian Feng of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), took a detailed look at the new migrants. To <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flesh</span> it out, The Economist conducted its own (admittedly <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unscientific</span>) poll of 90 migrants between the ages of 18 and 33 in six areas of Beijing and Guangzhou, a large southern city. Combined with earlier studies, these surveys build up a detailed <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">portrait</span> of a slice of Chinese society roiled by change.\n \n Mr Tian\u2019s study is based on five surveys of social conditions, conducted by CASS between 2006 and 2015. It shows that migrants born in the 1960s and 1970s had ten or fewer years of formal education, but those born <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aft</span>er 1980 had 12 or more years. While the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">quantity</span> of education received by the new generation is higher, the quality is not. The hukou system makes it difficult for many migrants in the biggest cities to secure places for their children in state-run schools, so they send them to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ramshackle</span> private ones that are often forced to close. A study from 2010 found that only 17% of migrants with children in such schools in Beijing thought their offspring were getting a good education. Matters have not improved. A cleaner in Beijing who sends her son to a private <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">kindergarten</span> told The Economist that \u201cthe quality of education is nothing like as good as in state schools.\u201d\n \n \n Not much to smile about\n Many members of the new generation were educated in villages, separate from their migrant parents who worked in the cities. A study by the Second Military Medical University of Shanghai found that such children did worse than average <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">academically</span> and were more likely to be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">depressed</span>. Despite such problems, many parents feel they have no choice but to leave their children in the care of relatives in the countryside. \u201cI <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">haven</span>\u2019t thought about bringing my kid here,\u201d says a cook in Beijing, \u201cbecause I can\u2019t afford to.\u201d\n \n \n The younger generation are products of China\u2019s one-child policy, which went into force nationwide in 1980 (although in the countryside, families were sometimes allowed two). They are among the first to suffer its unintended <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">consequence</span>s. The one-child policy contributed to a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">drastic</span> change in the sex ratio because female fetuses were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aborted</span> by parents who wanted their only child to be a boy. The ratio of boys to girls at birth soared in the 1980s, peaking in 2005, when there were 122 baby boys for every 100 baby girls, one of the most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">distorted</span> ratios ever seen.\n \n \n The average age of first marriage in China is 26. The first of the new-generation migrants are reaching that age. Already, the marriage chances of migrant men are falling. Wang Chunguang, another <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scholar</span> at CASS, found that three-quarters of the new-generation migrants he studied were unmarried. The group he looked at included some 18- to 25-year-olds, who may have been single because they were too young (in China, women must be at least 20 to get married and men at least 22). But that does not fully explain the low overall rate. In The Economist\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sample</span>, two-thirds of migrants were unmarried. Only two said they had any wedding plans. A 25-year-old manager of a food company in Beijing admitted, \u201cI would need to have a much better-paid job or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">promotion</span> before thinking about getting a girlfriend.\u201d\n \n \n The marriage <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeeze</span> is about to tighten. By 2020, the government says, there will be 30m more men of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">marriageable</span> age than women: six <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bride</span>s for seven brothers, in effect. Young migrant men will suffer all the more because of a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">preference</span> among Chinese women for marrying men with more money or education (a practice known as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hypergamy</span>). According to Yue Qian of Ohio State University, 55% of college-educated Chinese men marry someone with less education, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">whereas</span> only 32% of university-educated women do the same. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hypergamy</span> happens at every level of society. As a result, two groups find it hard to get <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">spouse</span>s: women with a lot of education (known <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">derisively</span> as sheng nu, or left-behind women), and men with only a little schooling. Young male migrants usually belong in the second <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">category</span>.\n \n No wheels, no deal\n \n \n Among Chinese men generally, a common response to the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shortage</span> of women is for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospective</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">groom</span>s to buy an apartment and car before marriage\u2014a sort of reverse <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dowry</span>. One survey found that three-quarters of young women in big cities took this into account before accepting a man\u2019s offer. Alas for migrant <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">swain</span>s, they cannot afford such a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bride</span> price, especially in expensive cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou. It is usually difficult for people without a city\u2019s hukou to buy government-subsidised housing there. Young migrants are therefore at a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threefold</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">disadvantage</span>. There are fewer women of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">marriageable</span> age. Those who come from their own background tend to marry <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">richer</span> rivals. And the men cannot compete in the marriage market by buying property.\n \n \n Another problem is income. Rural people migrate to cities for money, and usually get far more of it than they would if they had not moved. Migrants\u2019 wages rose from around 1,700 yuan ($205) a month in 2000 to over 3,000 yuan in 2016. But the rate of increase fell from almost 17% a year at the start of 2012 to about 7% at the beginning of this year. Since 2015, their incomes have been rising more slowly than those of urban <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resident</span>s generally (see chart).\n \n \n The earnings of the youngest ones have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deteriorated</span> the most. Mr Tian looked at earnings by age. He found that the highest earners are those in their mid-30s (between 32 and 36). That remained <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">constant</span> in all his surveys. But there was a significant change among workers in their mid-20s (22 to 26). In 2008 these younger migrants were earning almost as much as the best-paid. By 2015, they were earning much less.\n \n \n This may be connected with changes in the nature of migrants\u2019 work, caused by an economic <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transformation</span> that is making China\u2019s growth more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reliant</span> on services and less on manufacturing. The earlier migrants <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">typically</span> found jobs in construction or on production lines. According to Mr Tian, 60% of migrants in 2008 worked in such \u201csecondary industry\u201d sectors. That share fell to 52% by 2015. Meanwhile, demand for migrants\u2019 labour in the \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tertiary</span> sector\u201d, ie, in services, has taken off. For the less well-educated this often involves <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">insecure</span> work in areas such as food <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">delivery</span> and cleaning.\n \n \n The best-laid plans of migrants...\n \n \n One result of this shift into shorter-term or part-time work has been a fall in savings. In the past almost all migrants used to save a third or more of their income to send back to their villages. But in The Economist\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sample</span> a third of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">respondent</span>s saved nothing. Most younger migrants \u201cwill not make the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sacrifice</span>s of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">frugal</span>ity in order to save money\u201d, harrumphs CASS\u2019s Mr Wang. \u201cIt is a far cry from their parents\u2019 generation.\u201d\n \n \n The <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">upshot</span> is that the new generation appears to be one of the most dissatisfied <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">segment</span>s of Chinese society. Because the country has no <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">reliable</span> opinion polls, this <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">judgment</span> must be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tentative</span>. But a proxy measure, the way people view their own <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">achievement</span>s, suggests it is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">accurate</span>.\n \n \n Mr Tian\u2019s survey includes a question about where <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">respondent</span>s place themselves in society on a scale from top to bottom. Between 2006 and 2015 the migrants he questioned gave, on average, ever lower <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assessment</span>s of their social position. Initially, the younger ones (aged between 22 and 26) were the most likely to describe themselves as being in the top half of society. By 2015 they were more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inclined</span> than older migrants to put themselves in the bottom half. Mr Tian concludes that those born in the 1990s are the most disappointed of the migrants he has studied.\n \n \n The Economist\u2019s survey bears him out. Most migrants want to stay in the big city but few feel welcome there. \u201cThere is no sense of belonging,\u201d complains a 24-year-old coffee-shop waiter in Beijing. \u201cFor the moment I will stay,\u201d says a 28-year-old <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">hairstylist</span> who also lives in the capital, \u201cbut there\u2019s no sense of happiness.\u201d\n \n \n ...gang <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">aft</span> agley\n \n \n \n In some ways, little has changed. Most of the early migrants, concluded the Journal of Economic Research nine years ago \u201cknew they were just passers-by in cities. They came from rural areas and were fated to return there.\u201d But the new generation feels <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">alienated</span> from the countryside even as high living costs, the hukou system and social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discrimination</span> in the cities \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crush</span> their urban dreams\u201d as well. \u201cThey are truly marginalised people,\u201d it said.\n \n \n \n How serious a threat to social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stability</span> are they? They seem unlikely to challenge the party itself (a surprising one in eight of those surveyed by The Economist said they were members of it). It is true that some of those <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"><span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">evic</span>ted</span> last winter in Beijing protested loudly. One group (pictured) <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">chanted</span> about human rights outside a local-government building. By and large, though, these are exceptions. Most migrants are not politically active. Few of those who spoke to The Economist were willing to talk about politics. Those who did mostly said they supported the p<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resident</span>, Xi Jinping, because of his anti-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">corruption</span> campaign.\n \n \n \n Low-end people\u201d object to being <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"><span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">evic</span>ted</span>\n The party, however, cannot take their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">passivity</span> for granted. Throughout Chinese history, opposition has seemed <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">mute</span>d right up to the point when it has <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">explode</span>d. Yu Jianrong of CASS wrote in 2014 that the social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exclusion</span> felt by new-generation migrants could <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">forge</span> a sense of common political cause among them that could even lead to revolution. Mr Yu called this a \u201c<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">colossal</span> hidden threat to China\u2019s future social <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stability</span>\u201d. There is little sign of that yet, but there are several reasons for thinking migrants might become more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">restless</span>.\n \n \n \n As the marriage <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">squeeze</span> tightens, it will produce a generation of unmarried migrant men with low incomes, poor education and no tie to the social order that marriage provides in China. It is a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">recipe</span> for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discontent</span>. Mr Tian worries about a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">vicious</span> cycle developing, with poor education leading to low income that results in anti-social attitudes and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">disruption</span> to children\u2019s schooling.\n \n \n \n Migrants form a huge group, roughly as numerous as the middle class. But compared with the middle class, they have little to lose and less to keep them <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">loyal</span> to the party. They <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">revel</span> in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">subculture</span>s that the party dislikes. Chinese <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rap</span> music has its roots among young migrants, who were also the main users of Neihan Duanzi, a popular app specialising in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bawdy</span> jokes that state <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">censors</span> closed down in April. There are signs that some young migrants are starting to organise themselves. Strikes over pay and conditions have become more common. In April a court in Tongzhou, a district of Beijing (next to the area where the forced <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"><span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">evic</span>t</span>ions took place), said 32% of the labour disputes referred to it involved collective agreements, almost double the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">proportion</span> in 2016. This suggested there was a link between the number of disputes and the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">expulsion</span> of migrants.\n \n \n The biggest uncertainty is what will happen if the economy <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">falter</span>s. The party does not seem ready for this. The social-safety net is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">threadbare</span>. The hukou regime means migrants cannot get full access to it anyway. Modernisers want to reform the system and allow migrants to live more securely in cities. But change has been slow and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">patchy</span>. (In Guangzhou only two of the 40 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">respondent</span>s to The Economist\u2019s survey had a local hukou.) The government is trying to cap the size of giant cities by pushing migrants out. Charles Parton of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London, says young migrants will not <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overthrow</span> the party, but if the economy <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stagnate</span>s \u201cthey will cause a lot more trouble than they do now.\u201d\n \n \n The new generation is entering a difficult period. Its men will remain unmarried and its children will often be educated away from home. Many will be on low, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">insecure</span> wages. If the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\"><span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">evic</span>t</span>ions in Beijing are any guide, the party\u2019s reaction to any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discontent</span> is likely to be greater <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">repression</span>. That would make solving migrants\u2019 deep-seated problems harder, and an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">explosion</span> of rage more likely.\n", "next": "2018_5_15_2.json", "last": "2018_5_14_11.json"}
