Nonetheless, the region will leave along with the rest of the United Kingdom on March 29th next year. The Republic of Ireland, of course, will continue to be a member of the club. This means that for the first time the EU will have an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">external</span> border on the island of Ireland. What will be the political and economic consequences? \n During the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sectarian</span> Troubles\u201d of 1968-98, the Irish border was for much of the time heavily <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fortified</span>. People and goods crossing the 500km <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">frontier</span> were stopped for customs and identity checks, as British army helicopters whirred <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">overhead</span>. These days, in contrast, one can drive across the border without noticing it. Security measures were phased out following the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998, and the EU\u2019s single market and customs union have <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">banished</span> the need for <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inspections</span> of imports and exports between the two countries. \n If the United Kingdom leaves the single market and customs union, as Theresa May\u2019s government intends, those <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inspections</span> will return in some form. But how? Ireland says it would not accept customs checks or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">infrastructure</span> at the border, and Mrs May promises there will be none. She rules out the idea of Northern Ireland remaining in a customs union, aligned with single-market regulations, as this would have the effect of creating a customs border within the UK. The whole country could stay in the single market and customs union. But she <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">rejects</span> that as a watered-down sort of Brexit. The EU, for its part, dismisses Mrs May\u2019s suggestion that technology could allow invisible checks at the border or that the UK could collect duties in Northern Ireland on behalf of the EU. \n Mrs May will surely have to soften one of her red lines\u201d But doing so threatens to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">inflame</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nationalist</span> passions of one sort or another. A hard land border would <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">appal</span> Irish <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nationalists</span>, for whom the open border is a crucial part of the Good Friday deal. Customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would upset Northern Ireland\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unionists</span>, who are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sensitive</span> to anything that separates them. Keeping the whole of the UK in a customs union, meanwhile, would be seen by English <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">nationalists</span> as a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">betrayal</span> of Brexit, as it would limit the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prospect</span> of trade deals with new countries. Whichever <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">concession</span> Mrs May makes, expect fireworks. \n \n", "title": "What Brexit means for the Irish border\n", "last": "2018_5_1_2.json"}
