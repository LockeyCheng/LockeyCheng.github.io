{"date": "2018-05-29 22:21:36", "content": "\n His high chances are more a reflection of a weakening field than a sudden <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resurgence</span>\n \n NO TENNIS player has ever <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">dominate</span>d a surface like Rafael Nadal has on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">clay</span>. The 31-year-old <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Spaniard</span> has won ten of his 16 grand-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slam</span> titles at the French Open, and will be hoping to make it 11 over the next <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fortnight</span> at Roland Garros <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">stadium</span>. Only a brave <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">punter</span> would bet against him. Betfred, a bookmaker, is giving odds of 2/5 that he will <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">triumph</span> on the Court Philippe Chatrier\u2014an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">imp</span>lied chance of about 71%, though bookies tend to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exaggerate</span> these by a couple of percentage points in order to guarantee a profit. Only three times since 2005 have the bookmakers pegged the men\u2019s favourite at shorter odds.\n \n Yet that is more a reflection of a weakening field than a sudden <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">resurgence</span> in Mr Nadal\u2019s <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">bicep</span>-bulging play. Granted, he won two <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slam</span>s last year, after a three-year dry spell. But \n \n , a tennis-statistics website, suggest that the current version of \u201cThe King of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Clay</span>\u201d would lose his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">crown</span> two times out of three to the peak version of himself, aged 22 in 2009.\n \n That the champions and contenders of today are older than those of <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">yore</span> is \n \n . But eventually Father Time catches up with even the spriteliest athletes. In Paris, Mr Nadal s<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">imply</span> seems to be the last man standing. Roger Federer no longer competes at Roland Garros, in order to save his 36-year-old legs for the Wimbledon <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">tournament</span>, which takes place two weeks later. Sir Andy Murray is missing with a hip injury. Novak Djokovic is still recovering from an operation on his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">elbow</span> in January: having lost six of his 13 matches since, he is seeded 20th. Stan Wawrinka has won just four of ten matches in 2018.\n \n To make things even easier, both Mr Djokovic and Mr Wawrinka are in the bottom half of the draw, along with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Dominic</span> Thiem and Alexander Zverev, the two young stars of the professional tour. Mr Nadal may never get an easier chance to add to his <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">voluminous</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">trophy</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabinet</span>. As the chart shows, however, he should be <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">wary</span> of being too <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">complacent</span>.
