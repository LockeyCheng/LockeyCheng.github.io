Ryanair\u2019s passenger numbers are growing and costs per seat-kilometre <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flown</span> are\u2014just about\u2014lower than its competitors\u2019. But investors have been sent into a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">flap</span> by its announcement on July 23rd that its profits in the first quarter fell 20% year-on-year, which sent its share price down nearly 7% on the day. Growing demand for pilots and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cabin</span> crew is having an effect. Last September the airline was forced to cancel over 2,000 flights owing to a pilot <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">shortage</span>. To attract enough staff to keep up with its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">breakneck</span> expansion it has been improving pay and conditions, as well as recognising trade unions for the first time. That decision has already made itself felt: this week Ryanair is cancelling more than 600 flights because of striking staff.\n \n Neil Sorahan, Ryanair\u2019s finance director, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cite</span>s other factors for the slide in profits. The amount of airline capacity in Europe is growing faster than demand, putting <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">downward</span> pressure on fares. And on the cost side, rising oil prices has increased the price that Ryanair pays for most of its fuel from $49 to $58 per <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">barrel</span> year-on-year. Even so Wizz Air, a fast-growing <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Hungarian</span> competitor that uses cheaper eastern European staff, is snapping at its <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">heel</span>s. And its boss, Jozsef Varadi, is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">eager</span> to profit from the Irish <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">carrier</span>\u2019s problems. Several analysts say that it could match Ryanair\u2019s unit costs, in terms of cost per passenger-kilometre, by the end of the year. That will hit the Irish <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">carrier</span>\u2019s profits\u2014and its share price\u2014even further.", "last": "2018_7_25_1.json", "next": "2018_7_25_3.json", "assistent": {"Hungarian": {"ex": ["n. \u5308\u7259\u5229\u4eba\uff1b\u5308\u7259\u5229\u8bed", "adj. \u5308\u7259\u5229\u7684\uff1b\u5308\u7259\u5229\u4eba\u7684\uff1b\u5308\u7259\u5229\u8bed\u7684", "\u7f51\u7edc \u5308\u7259\u5229\u6587\uff1b\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5f0f"], "pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0[h\u028c\u014b'\u0261e\u0259r\u026a\u0259n] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0"}, "eg2": []}, "barrel": {"pron": {"peg": "\u82f1\u00a0['b\u00e6r\u0259l] ", "pam": "\u7f8e\u00a0['ber\u0259l] "}, "ex": ["n. \u6876\uff1b\u67aa\u7ba1\uff1b\u4e00\u6876\uff08\u7684\u91cf\uff09", "v. \u98de\u9a70", "\u7f51\u7edc \u7435\u7436\u6876\uff1b\u5706\u7b52\uff1b\u6eda\u7b52"], "eg2": [["a beer/wine barrel", "\u5564\u9152\u6876\uff1b\u8461\u8404\u9152\u6876"], ["They got through two barrels of beer.", "\u4ed6\u4eec\u559d\u4e86\u4e24\u6876\u5564\u9152\u3002"], ["Oil prices fell to $9 a barrel.", "\u77f3\u6cb9\u4ef7\u683c\u964d\u5230\u4e86\u6bcf\u6876 9 \u5143\u3002"], ["Life hasn't exactly been a barrel of laughs lately.", "\u6700\u8fd1\u751f\u6d3b\u5e76\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u4ee4\u4eba\u5f00\u5fc3\u3002"], ["Life hasn't exactly been a barrel of laughs lately.", "\u6700\u8fd1\u751f\u6d3b\u5e76\u4e0d\u5341\u5206\u4ee4\u4eba\u5f00\u5fc3\u3002"], ["They've got us over a barrel.
