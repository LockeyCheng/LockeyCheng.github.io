As a teenager I spent hours on <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">anonymous</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">internet</span> chat rooms claiming to like men and women but really only chatting to men. I dated a young woman at school. I suppose people <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">assume</span>d I was straight. Through my twenties I avoided questions from my family about going without sex or a relationship. For years I wanted to sleep with men but I didn\u2019t want to call myself \u201cgay\u201d. I wanted the behaviour, but not the identity.\u00a0\n \n Plenty of men have sex with men without calling themselves gay, especially in places where the sex act is a criminal offence or culturally <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">unacceptable</span>. \u201cGay men\u201d are a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">subset</span> of all the men who have sex with men. One day, knowing that men attracted me most, I looked at myself in the mirror and said the word: gay. \u201cGay\u201d described who I was. My identity. I embraced that identity after years of hoping that it wouldn\u2019t stick. I am just one of those men who sleeps with men who make their <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sexuality</span> into a part of their identity.\u00a0\n \n For human society, as for the individual, it is a little <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">leap</span> to turn a common behaviour into something that is seen as an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">innate</span> part of some people\u2019s nature, or identity. With regard to being gay, this didn\u2019t begin to happen in human history until the last century or so. Men had been having sex with each other for centuries before then. Likewise women with women. Gay sex is common in <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">depiction</span>s of human life, from different eras, in stories, plays, drawings, and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pottery</span>\u2014and all over the world. It wasn\u2019t until the late 19th century when Karl <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Heinrich</span> Ulrichs, a German lawyer, was the first to argue in speeches and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">pamphlet</span>s that same-sex desire was a part of who he was that the idea of being \u201cgay\u201d was first said publicly. He used another word than \u201cgay\u201d, and a slightly different concept to the one we use today (he actually saw it as a third gender). But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fundamentally</span> Ulrichs helped to expand \u201cgay\u201d out of something that people merely do into something that people are. His theories were largely rejected by doctors, <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">psychiatrist</span>s and lawyers who sought to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">uphold</span> the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prevail</span>ing notion that same-sex love was a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">perversion</span> and a danger. But he inspired the creation of the first gay-rights organisation in Berlin in 1897.\n \n Around 80 years later, Harvey Milk (pictured above) marched through American cities and called on fellow Americans to come out\u2014to say the word \u201cgay\u201d and to stamp their name on it. As Milk believed it would, this identity-based argument led to legal rights, from anti-<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">discrimination</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">legislation</span> to same-sex marriage. When you can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">convince</span> someone that this harmless thing you do is an <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">innate</span> part of your identity, your nature, just who you are, then in societies based on the freedom of the individual, no argument against you can <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">prevail</span>.\n \n The most politically successful use of the identity-based argument is in the global gay-marriage campaign. That is probably because it is about love, rather than the more <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">controversial</span> subject of sex. Everyone knows what it is like to love.\u00a0\n \n Gay activists claimed that our <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">sexuality</span> is a part of our identity, and then used the notion of love to make that point <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">universal</span>. This is how gay people became more and more accepted in society, and respected in law.\n \n <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Transgender</span> people, however, struggle more than gay people to be understood. It is a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">peculiar</span> fact that in countries that are becoming more accepting of different sexual identities, the freedom to be accepted as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Transgender</span> is <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lag</span>ging behind.\n \n <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Transgender</span> people are told <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">ignorant</span> things. You can change how you feel. You are <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">confuse</span>d. You are eroding the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fabric</span> of society. You want to ruin children. You don\u2019t belong here. You want silly rights. These are all charges that were commonly laid against gay people in countries that now have same-sex marriage and widespread acceptance of gay people. That is not to say that gay people in countries like Britain and America never hear these statements any more, but they are far less acceptable than in the past.\n \n Perhaps one reason for the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">lag</span> in understanding is that it is harder for the majority of people to empathise with <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transgender</span> people. If you are comfortable describing yourself as \u201cwoman\u201d or \u201cman\u201d and most people believe you, then it is hard to imagine how you could feel otherwise.\u00a0\n \n When gay activists made their arguments about whom they want to love, it became easier for others to understand. <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Transgender</span> identity is about how the <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">beholder</span> feels on the inside\u2014so it is harder to explain.\n \n One way is to talk about being comfortable wearing the clothes you want. But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">fundamentally</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transgender</span> identity is not about wearing this shirt or that skirt, or even using this bathroom or the other one. It is about how someone feels on the inside. It is about how they alone feel about who they are. It is all on the inside. That makes it hard for others to grasp. But <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transgender</span> people just want the world to <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">perceive</span> them in the same way as they see themselves. Society has to try harder.\n \n What\u2019s the first step? Ask a <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">transgender</span> person for their name. It is how they choose to describe in words who they really are.", "last": "2018_7_10_2.json", "next": "2018_7_11_2.json", "assistent": {"Heinrich": {"ex": ["n.
