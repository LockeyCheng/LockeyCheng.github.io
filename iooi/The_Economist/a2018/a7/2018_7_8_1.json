In 2011, when Netflix was first moving into streaming video, he bought \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d, a television drama starring Kevin <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Spacey</span> and Robin <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Wright</span> and produced by, among others, the film director David Fincher, for $100m. The nine-figure statement of intent was widely <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">deride</span>d as <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">profligate</span>, showing that Netflix might be a source of cash but <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">scarcely</span> offered serious competition. A mail-order video store could hardly be expected to take on networks and <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">studio</span>s that took decades to build and were <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">notoriously</span> difficult to run.\n \n Instead, Netflix has become an industry in and of itself. Mr Sarandos, the company\u2019s chief content officer, and his colleagues will spend $12bn-13bn this year\u2014more than any <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">studio</span> spends on films, or any television company lays out on stuff that isn\u2019t sport. Their viewers will get 82 feature films in a year when <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">Warner</span> Brothers, the Hollywood <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">studio</span> with the biggest <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">slate</span>, will send <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">cinema</span>s only 23. (Disney, the most <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">profitable</span> <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">studio</span>, is putting out just ten.) Netflix is producing or procuring 700 new or <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">exclusively</span> licensed television shows, including more than 100 <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">script</span>ed dramas and comedies, dozens of documentaries and children\u2019s shows, stand-up <span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">comedy</span> specials and un<span class=\"fa fa-info-circle\">script</span>ed reality and talk shows. And its ambitions go far beyond Hollywood. It is currently making programmes in 21 countries, including Brazil, Germany, India and South Korea.\n \n Read more in our ", "last": "2018_7_7_6.json", "next": "2018_7_8_2.json", "assistent": {"Spacey": {"ex": ["\u53e4\u602a\u7684", "n.
